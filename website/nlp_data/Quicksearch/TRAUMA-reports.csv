THE LIVER, PANCREAS, ADRENALS AND KIDNEYS ARE NORMAL IN APPEARANCE AND  ENHANCEMENT CHARACTERISTICS.  NO SMALL OR LARGE BOWEL ABNORMALITY IS  IDENTIFIED. CONCLUSION:  THE DIFFERENTIAL OF THIS LOW DENSITY LESION INCLUDES A CYST, MOST LIKELY  POST TRAUMATIC; A METASTASIS BUT MOST LIKELY IN HER CLINICAL SETTING  TUBERCULOGRANULOMA.  IF THE PATIENT IS IMMUNO-COMPROMISED THE DIFFERENTIAL SHOULD INCLUDE LYMPHOMA. AS THE LESION IS CLEARLY SEEN ON ULTRASOUND SENSIBLE FOLLOW UP WOULD BE WITH  A 6 WEEK REPEAT ULTRASOUND SCAN TO CHECK ON THE SIZE OF THE LESION.  SCAN REVIEWED BY DR BUCKLEY ",Organ trauma

TECHNIQUE:   POST CONTRAST AXIAL SCANS WERE PERFORMED FROM THE LUNG BASES TO THE  SYMPHYSIS PUBIS. DELAYED SCANS WERE ALSO PERFORMED FOLLOWING REPEATED  ADMINISTRATIONS OF FURTHER ORAL CONTRAST TO DISTEND THE STOMACH.   REPORT:   THERE ARE BILATERAL SMALL EFFUSIONS WITH ADJACENT CONSOLIDATION SLIGHTLY  MORE MARKED ON THE LEFT.  THERE IS A MODERATE SIZED RIGHT PNEUMOTHORAX.  THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF GAS IMMEDIATELY UNDERNEATH THE LEFT  HEMIDIAPHRAGM.  THE GAS OUTLINES A COMPRESSED STOMACH WHICH CONTAINS A  NASOGASTRIC TUBE, AND TRACKS LATERALLY AND POSTERIORLY TO OUTLINE AN  EXTREMELY IRREGULAR, NECROTIC APPEARING SPLEEN.  THE SPLEEN DOES NOT  ENHANCE.  THE GAS ALSO TRACKS INTO THE SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUES OF THE LATERAL  CHEST WALL, AND ALONG THE TRACT OF THE PREVIOUS UWSD.  AMONGST THIS LARGE GAS COLLECTION, AND LYING IMMEDIATELY POSTERIOR TO THE  COMPRESSED STOMACH, IS A LARGE OVOID SOFT TISSUE MASS, ALSO CONTAINING GAS.   THERE IS HYPERDENSITY WITHIN THIS COLLECTION CONSISTENT WITH INTRAVENOUS  CONTRAST. ON SUBSEQUENT RUNS THIS DENSITY IS SEEN TO DIFFUSE, ALTHOUGH  REMAINS CONTAINED WITHIN THE SOFT TISSUE MASS.

THE LIVER AND PANCREAS ENHANCE SATISFACTORILY AND APPEAR MORPHOLOGICALLY WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.  THE RIGHT KIDNEY IS UNREMARKABLE.  NO OBVIOUS BONY ABNORMALITY DEMONSTRATED.   COMMENT:   THE OVERALL FEATURES IN THE LEFT HYPOCHONDRIUM ARE VERY UNUSUAL.  THE  ADMINISTRATION OF ORAL CONTRAST SUGGESTS THAT THE STOMACH, ALTHOUGH  COMPRESSED ANTERIORLY, IS INTACT, AS ARE ALL AREAS OF BOWEL.  THE SPLEEN IS  NECROTIC.  THE HYPERDENSITY SEEN WITHIN THE SOFT TISSUE MASS WOULD APPEAR TO  REPRESENT EXTRAVASATION OF INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST, AND EROSION OF THE LEFT  GASTRIC OR SPLENIC ARTERIES NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED.  THE SOFT TISSUE MASS  ITSELF WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH AN INFECTED OR NECROTIC COLLECTION, AND MAY  REPRESENT HAEMATOMA/BOWEL CONTENTS.    THE ETIOLOGY OF ALL THESE CHANGES IS UNCERTAIN.  IT MAY REPRESENT TRAUMA TO  THIS REGION, WITH ENSUING INFECTION.  ALTERNATIVELY, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN  EROSION THROUGH EITHER STOMACH OR BOWEL AS A PRIMARY PROCESS, WITH RESULTANT  VASCULAR INVOLVEMENT AND BLEEDING.

FINDINGS:   ARTERIAL PHASE FOLLOWED BY PORTAL VENOUS PHASE IMAGING. COMPARISON WITH  PREVIOUS CT OF 08/04/12.  MULTIPLE LACERATIONS ARE EVIDENT WITHIN THE SPLEEN.

GIVEN THE PATIENT'S YOUNG AGE THIS IS UNLIKELY TO REPRESENT ATHEROMA AND SUSPICIOUS FOR TRAUMATIC INJURY/INTERMAL DISRUPTIONS. THE VESSEL AND ITS BRANCHES OPACIFY NORMALLY DISTALLY. SMA APPEARS UNREMARKABLE. SUBTLE THICKENING OF THE LEFT POSTEROLATERAL WALL OF THE AORTA JUST SUPERIOR TO THE BIFURCATION COULD REPRESENT SIMILAR PATHOLOGY. THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT AORTIC STENOSIS.  NO FREE GAS.  THERE IS A TRACE OF FREE FLUID IN THE PELVIS. NO FREE  INTRAPERITONEAL GAS IDENTIFIED. NO FOCAL BOWEL PATHOLOGY IS SEEN THOUGH MILD  MUCOSAL ENHANCEMENT IN THE SMALL BOWEL COULD BE REFLECTIVE OF HYPOVOLEMIA.  THE IVC IS CURRENTLY OF REASONABLY GOOD CALIBRE. THE PANCREAS IS QUITE BULKY  BUT THERE WAS NO SURROUNDING MESENTERIC STRANDING AND IT ENHANCES UNIFORMLY AND NO FOCAL INJURY IS IDENTIFIED. THE BLADDER IS MODERATELY DISTENDED WITH URINE AND THE PERIVESICAL FAT IS CLEAN.  LUMBAR SPINE ALIGNMENT IS SATISFACTORY WITH NO EVIDENCE OF ACUTE FRACTURE.  THE PELVIC RING AND PROXIMAL FEMURS APPEAR INTACT.   RIGHT ANKLE:   THERE IS A SWALLOW DEPRESSION IN THE MEDIAL TALAR DOME OVER APPROXIMATELY  12MM WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE WELL CORTICATED MARGINS SUGGESTING IT COULD BE  LONGSTANDING. THERE IS NO ANKLE JOINT EFFUSION THEREFORE ACUTE OSTEOCHONDRAL  INJURIES IS THOUGHT UNLIKELY. NO OSSEOUS FRAGMENT SEEN WITHIN THE JOINT  SPACE. CALCIFICATION ADJACENT TO THE POSTERIOR MALLEOLUS IS ALSO SUGGESTIVE  OF OLD INJURY. CLINICAL CORRELATION IS WARRANTED. THERE IS VERY SLIGHT LATERAL TALAR TILT BUT NO LATERAL TALAR SHIFT OR SYNDESMOTIC WIDENING. TINY FRAGMENTS ADJACENT TO THE ANTERIOR PROCESS OF THE CALCANEUS ARE TOO SMALL TO  DEFINITELY CHARACTERISE AS AN ACUTE OR OLD INJURY. THE REMAINING TARSALS  APPEAR UNREMARKABLE AND ALIGNMENT OF THE MID AND HINDFOOT IS ANATOMICAL.   CONCLUSION:   1. NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL PATHOLOGY. NO SPINAL OR PELVIC FRACTURE.  2. MULTIPLE RIGHT POSTERIOR RIB FRACTURES, MODERATE HAEMOTHORAX AND  PULMONARY CONTUSION.  3. LARGE RIGHT LOBE LIVER LACERATION WITH SUSPICION OF ACTIVE HAEMORRHAGE  AND LARGE PERIHEPATIC HAEMATOMA.  4. SMALL SPLENIC CAPSULAR TEAR WITH SURROUNDING HAEMATOMA. NO EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE BLEEDING.  5. HYPODENSITIES IN THE RIGHT RENAL UPPER AND LOWER POLE ARE SUSPECTED  LACERATIONS BUT COULD ALSO REPRESENT PERFUSION ABNORMALITY IN THE LOWER  POLE. CONTAINED RENAL VEIN INJURY. THE PATIENT MAY BE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING  RENAL VEIN THROMBOSIS BUT THE VESSEL IS CURRENTLY PATENT. ASSESSMENT OF THE  RENAL COLLECTING SYSTEM WITH DELAYED PHASE PYELOGRAM CT IS INDICATED.  6. SUSPECTED TRAUMATIC INJURY TO THE PROXIMAL CELIAC TRUNK RESULTING IN SOME  NARROWING BUT NOT OCCLUSION OF THE VESSEL. THERE IS SIMILAR INTIMAL  THICKENING IN THE DISTAL AORTA.  7.

13R049905,"CT UPPER ABDOMEN   CLINICAL DETAILS:  ?BLUNT TRAUMA TO RIGHT LATERAL CHEST (KNEE VERSUS CHEST) COMPLAINS OF RIGHT  UPPER QUADRANT PAIN.  TO EXCLUDE LIVER INJURY.    IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CLINICAL REQUEST, CT OF THE UPPER ABDOMEN HAS BEEN  PERFORMED WITH FOCUS ON THE LIVER.  COMBINED ARTERIAL/VENOUS PHASE TRAUMA  PROTOCOL INJECTION OF CONTRAST HAS BEEN PERFORMED.    THERE IS A LARGE IRREGULAR LACERATION INVOLVING THE RIGHT LOBE OF THE LIVER,  PARTICULARLY SEGMENT 6, 7 AND 8.  HYPODENSITY EXTENDS TO THE LIVER CAPSULE,  BUT THERE IS NO FREE PERIHEPATIC FLUID AND NO SUBCAPSULAR HAEMATOMA IS  IDENTIFIED.   NO EXTRAVASATION OF CONTRAST IS SEEN TO SUGGEST ACTIVE ONGOING  BLEEDING.    THERE IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF FLUID SEEN AROUND THE SPLEEN.  THERE IS QUITE  HETEROGENEOUS ENHANCEMENT OF THE SPLEEN DUE TO THE PREDOMINANTLY ARTERIAL  PHASE OF THE STUDY.  THE PRESENCE OF FLUID IS CONCERNING FOR AN UNDERLYING  SPLENIC LACERATION, ALTHOUGH A DEFINITE LACERATION IS DIFFICULT TO  DEMONSTRATE.  NO DEFINED SUBCAPSULAR SPLENIC HAEMATOMA IS IDENTIFIED.    PANCREAS APPEARS NORMAL. THERE IS NO FREE RETROPERITONEAL FLUID.  BOTH   KIDNEYS APPEAR UNREMARKABLE.  NO UPPER ABDOMINAL VASCULAR INJURY IS  IDENTIFIED.

THERE  ARE MINIMALLY DISPLACED FRACTURES OF THE RIGHT 7TH AND 8TH RIBS LATERALLY.    CONCLUSION: SIGNIFICANT LIVER LACERATION INVOLVING SEGMENT 6, 7 AND 8.  NO ACTIVE EXTRAVASATION.    FREE FLUID AROUND THE SPLEEN.  POSSIBILITY OF AN UNDERLYING SPLENIC  LACERATION NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED, ALTHOUGH IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY  DEMONSTRATE ON THIS PREDOMINANTLY ARTERIAL PHASE STUDY.    AT THE TIME OF FOLLOW UP IMAGING, A MORE VENOUS PHASE STUDY COULD BE  PERFORMED TO BETTER ASSESS THE SPLEEN.

THERE IS GROSS ASCITES WITHIN THE ABDOMEN WITH MOST FLUID TRACKING ALONG THE  LATERAL PARACOLIC GUTTERS WITH A COLLECTION IN THE PELVIS.  THE LIVER HAD A SLIGHTLY NODULAR EDGE AND ABNORMAL CONTOUR BUT HAS APPROPRIATE CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT.  THERE IS A HYPOATTENUATING LESION WITH SEGMENT 4 OF THE LIVER.  THIS MAY REPRESENT A PSEUDO LESION BUT GIVEN THE CONCERN FOR HEPATOMA AN ULTRASOUND IS SUGGESTED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.   THE GALLBLADDER IS WELL DISTENDED WITH NO EVIDENCE OF CHOLELITHIASIS. VISUALISED PANCREAS IS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.  THE SPLEEN IS OF NORMAL SIZE AND CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT.  THERE IS BOWEL WALL THICKENING THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE SMALL AND LARGE BOWEL  WHICH MAY BE IN KEEPING WITH A LOW PROTEIN STATE OR BE DUE TO THE  CONCOMITANT ASCITES.
