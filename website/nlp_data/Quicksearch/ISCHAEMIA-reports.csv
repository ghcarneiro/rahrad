INVESTIGATED BUT WITH NO CLEAR CAUSE.  PAST HISTORY  OF DIVERTICULAR DISEASE AND RIGHT INGUINAL HERNIA REPAIR.  INCREASED GAS ON  AXR YESTERDAY.  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  THERE IS INCREASE IN THE INTRAABDOMINAL FREE GAS SINCE THE PREVIOUS STUDY  FROM 10/10/2012 PERFORMED AT MODBURY.  NEW FROM THE PREVIOUS STUDY IS THE PRESENCE OF PNEUMATOSIS INTESTINALIS, INVOLVING SOME SMALL BOWEL LOOPS IN THE CENTRAL AND UPPER ABDOMEN.  THESE BOWEL LOOPS MEASURE UP TO 3CM IN MAXIMUM DIAMETER.  THERE IS SOME NON DISTENDED SMALL BOWEL LOOPS IN THE PELVIS, AND IN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ABDOMEN.  A RIGHT INGUINAL HERNIA IS PRESENT, WHICH DOES CONTAIN SOME FREE GAS AND A  SMALL BOWEL LOOP. UNFORTUNATELY IT IS DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THE SMALL BOWEL  LOOPS IN THIS REGION, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONFIRM WHETHER THERE IS ANY  TRANSITION POINT.  THERE IS SOME SWIRLING OF THE MESENTERY SEEN CENTRALLY,  WHICH CAN BE SEEN IN THE SETTING OF INTERNAL HERNIA, ALTHOUGH AGAIN BOWEL  LOOPS ARE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW AND THERE IS NO DEFINITE TRANSITION POINT IN  THIS REGION.

NO ACUTE BONY ABNORMALITY SEEN. RELATIVELY TORTUOUS  SUBCLAVIAN VESSELS BILATERALLY. PACEMAKER NOTED.   CT ABDOMEN:   THERE IS LARGE VOLUME ASCITIC FLUID SEEN. THERE IS HOWEVER AN UNUSUAL AND  SLIGHTLY NODULAR APPEARANCE TO THE PERITONEUM, WHICH IS CONCERNING FOR  PERITONEAL MALIGNANCY.

CONCLUSION:   NO MASS LESION, OBSTRUCTION OR BOWEL ISCHAEMIA IDENTIFIED, WITHIN THE LIMITS  OF THE NON CONTRAST STUDY. SIGNIFICANT ASCITES, COULD BE SECONDARY TO A  CARDIAC TYPE OF CIRRHOSIS, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE THIRD SPACE LOSS SEEN  ELSEWHERE, HOWEVER THE DENSITY OF THE LIVER REQUIRES THAT AMIODARONE THERAPY PREVIOUSLY NEEDS CLINICAL INVESTIGATION. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN MOSAIC ATTENUATION WITHIN THE LUNG FIELDS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS STUDY FROM 10 DAYS AGO.
