CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: 8MM POST CONTRAST AXIAL SLICES OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.  MINIMAL BIBASAL ATELECTASIS.  THE LIVER AND SPLEEN, PANCREAS, KIDNEYS, ADRENAL GLANDS AND GALLBLADDER SHOW NO FOCAL ABNORMALITY.  THERE IS NO FREE ABDOMINAL PERITONEAL FLUID.  IN THE LEFT ILIAC FOSSA THERE IS LARGE INFLAMMED MASS WHICH IS CONTINUOUS WITH THE DESCENDING COLON CONSISTENT WITH A LARGE DIVERTICULAR ABSCESS.  A COLONIC MALIGNANCY COULD HOWEVER ALSO HAVE THE SAME APPEARANCE.  THERE IS EVIDENCE OF DIVERTICULAR DISEASE EXTENSIVELY INVOLVING THE SIGMOID COLON.  AIR FLUID LEVEL IS SEEN WITHIN THE BLADDER, THE SIGMOID COLON IS CERTAINLY DRAPED IMMEDIATELY SUPERIORLY.  THE LARGE ABSCESS ACTUALLY SHOWS INFLAMMATORY CHANGES EXTENDING IMMEDIATELY TO THE RECTUS MUSCLE AND IS CONTINUOUS WITH THIS AND ITS MOST SUPERFICIAL MARGIN LIES ONLY TWO TO THREE CENTIMETRES BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN.  THERE IS A SURGICAL CLIP NOTED IN THE RIGHT GROIN AND A SMALL FOCUS OF CALCIFICATION WITHIN THE PROSTATE GLAND.

NO PREVIOUS IMAGING AVAILABLE FOR COMPARISON AT THE TIME OF REPORTING.  CT PROTOCOL: VENOUS PHASE CONTRAST ENHANCED AXIAL IMAGES FROM THE DOMES OF DIAPHRAGM TO SYMPHYSIS PUBIS. PRE CONTRAST AXIAL IMAGES THROUGH LIVER.  FINDINGS: THERE ARE INNUMERABLE LOW DENSITY ROUNDED HEPATIC LESIONS. SEVERAL OF WHICH ARE SUBCAPSULAR AND ARE DISTENDING THE CAPSULE. ARISING FROM SEGMENT 5 OF THE LIVER THERE IS A DIFFERENT LESION CONSISTING OF MULTIPLE AIR FLUID INTERFACES. IT MEASURES APPROXIMATELY 4.5CM IN DIAMETER. THE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH A HEPATIC ABSCESS. THERE ARE MULTIPLE HEPATIC METASTASES WITHIN THIS REGION EXTENDING FROM THE INFERIOR SURFACE OF THE LIVER. ADJACENT LOOP OF BOWEL APPROXIMATES THIS REGION WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE ASSOCIATED ABNORMAL SOFT TISSUE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE WHERE THE BOWEL LOOP STOPS AND THE LIVER SURFACE BEGINS. WHETHER THERE IS DIRECT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE ABSCESS AND BOWEL CANNOT BE ASCERTAINED. THERE IS NO ORAL CONTRAST WITHIN THE HEPATIC LESION. ABNORMAL SOFT TISSUE MASS WITHIN THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE CONSISTENT WITH TUMOUR DEPOSIT. THERE IS ALSO ABNORMAL SOFT TISSUE IN THE RIGHT PARASPINAL REGION AT THE LEVEL OF THE DIAPHRAGM CONSISTENT WITH METASTASIS. ADRENAL GLANDS NORMAL. SUSPECTED PERITONEAL DEPOSIT INFERIOR TO THE SPLEEN.

ABDOMEN AND PELVIS - CT COMPARED WITH A SIMILAR EXAMINATION TWO WEEKS AGO  SHOWS THAT THE SPLEEN IS NOW ENLARGED AND SWOLLEN AND CONTAINS A  HETEROGENEOUS LOW ATTENUATION AREA EXTENDING FROM THE HILAR OF THE SPLEEN TO  THE CORTEX.  THERE IS ALSO A HETEROGENEOUS MASS LESION IN THE REGION OF THE  TAIL OF THE PANCREAS ADJACENT TO THE SPLENIC HILUM AND THE SPLENIC VEIN IS  COMPRESSED BEHIND THIS MASS.  THE PORTAL VEIN IS PATENT.  THERE ARE NOW MULTIPLE VARICES IDENTIFIED IN THE UPPER ABDOMEN WHICH WERE  NOT PRESENT ON THE PREVIOUS CT SCAN.    THERE IS FLUID AROUND THE SPLEEN AND IN THE LEFT PARACOLIC GUTTER. OVERALL APPEARANCES ARE MORE IN FAVOUR IN INFECTION INVOLVING PANCREATITIS WITH ABSCESS FORMATION AND SECONDARY ABSCESSES IN THE SPLEEN ALTHOUGH THE SPLENIC LESIONS MAY BE INFARCTS.

THE DESCENDING COLON AT ITS  MID PORTION DISPLAYS ABNORMAL THICKENING WITH MULTIPLE OUTPOUCHING AND SURROUNDING INFLAMMATORY CHANGE.  THIS LOCATION IS FAVOURED AS THE SITE OF PERFORATION.    THERE IS AN ASSOCIATED FLUID DENSITY COLLECTION TRACKING UP THE LEFT  PARACOLIC GUTTER ADJACENT THE DISTAL DUODENUM AND JEJUNUM.  MURAL THICKENING  OF THE DISTAL DUODENUM IS FAVOURED TO BE SECONDARY TO ADJACENT INFLAMMATORY  CHANGE.  THERE IS LOCULATED FLUID ADJACENT THE SITE OF PERFORATION  CONSISTENT WITH EARLY ABSCESS FORMATION.  THE COLLECTION IS VERY  ILL-DEFINED.  THE LARGEST POCKET MEASURES APPROXIMATELY 3.5 X 4CM IN MAXIMUM  AXIAL DIMENSIONS.  AN ADDITION COLLECTION MEASURES 2.3 X 3.5CM AND IS  ADJACENT THE D3/4 SEGMENT OF THE DUODENUM.  THERE IS A SMALL VOLUME OF FREE FLUID IN THE PELVIS.    THERE IS A HYPODENSITY WITHIN SEGMENT 4A/B OF THE LIVER ADJACENT THE PORTA  HEPATIS.  THE LESION WAS NOT EVIDENT ON THE RECENT CT IN AUGUST.   DIFFERENTIAL INCLUDES A FOCAL PERFUSIONAL ABNORMALITY, OR LESS LIKELY AN  EARLY LIVER ABSCESS OR METASTASES. MRI OR ULTRASOUND COULD BETTER  CHARACTERISE.  THERE IS ABNORMAL FILLING OF A VENOUS BRANCH EXTENDING INTO THE SMA WHICH IS  MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO FLOW ARTEFACT HOWEVER A TINY VENOUS THROMBUS COULD  ALSO CAUSE THIS APPEARANCE. THE PORTAL VEIN AND SMV ARE WIDELY PATENT.  EXOPHYTIC HYPODENSE LESIONS WITHIN THE CORTEX OF THE KIDNEYS HAVE THE  APPEARANCE OF CORTICAL CYSTS.  THE ADRENALS AND BLADDER ARE UNREMARKABLE.   THE 6MM HYPODENSE CYST AT THE PANCREATIC HEAD IS UNCHANGED.  BACKGROUND EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES IN THE LUNG BASE WITH DEPENDENT DENSITY IN  THE LUNGS BILATERALLY WHICH APPEAR SIMILAR TO PRIOR.    NO SINISTER BONY LESIONS DETECTED.   CONCLUSION: PERFORATION OF THE MID DESCENDING COLON RESULTING IN EXTENSIVE FREE INTRA-ABDOMINAL GAS AND ADJACENT INFLAMMATORY COLLECTIONS CONSISTENT WITH ABSCESS FORMATION.    GIVEN THAT THE PERFORATION IS IN THE AREA OF MURAL ABNORMALITY DETECTED ON  PRIOR CT, THE POSSIBLE DIFFERENTIALS FOR THIS PERFORATION WOULD BE A PRIMARY  COLONIC MALIGNANCY WITH ULCERATION OR PERFORATION OF A DIVERTICULAE.

IN THE SUPERIOR ASPECT OF THE SPLEEN UNDERNEATH THE LEFT HEMIDIAPHRAGM THERE  IS A WEDGE SHAPED AREA OF HYPOATTENUATION CONSISTENT WITH AN AREA OF SPLENIC  INFARCTION.    THE INFERIOR POLE OF THE SPLEEN DISPLAYS A FURTHER TWO AREAS OF ROUNDED  HYPODENSITIES THAT DO NOT EXTEND ALL THE WAY TO THE SPLENIC CAPSULE AND THUS  WOULD BE ATYPICAL FOR AREAS OF INFARCTION.  THE DIFFERENTIAL IS BROAD AND  INCLUDES CYSTS, ABSCESS FORMATION, INFARCTION OR GRANULOMAS.  AN ULTRASOUND  COULD BETTER CHARACTERISE.

IN THE INFERIOR POLE OF THE SPLEEN THERE ARE A FURTHER TWO ROUNDED LESIONS  WHICH COULD REPRESENT INFARCTION ALTHOUGH THE ATTENUATION DOES NOT EXTEND TO  THE OUTER MARGIN. DIFFERENTIAL WOULD DEPEND ON CLINICAL PICTURE AND INCLUDE  ABSCESS FORMATION, GRANULOMAS OR CYSTS. CORRELATE WITH WHITE CELL COUNT AND  ANY FEVERS.  THESE LESIONS COULD BE FURTHER CHARACTERISED WITH AN  ULTRASOUND.  A TINY VOLUME OF FREE INTRA-ABDOMINAL FLUID WAS EVIDENT ON PRIOR SCAN OF  2013 AND LIKELY REPRESENTS ASCITES.

TENDERNESS AND REBOUND  TENDERNESS AT RIGHT ILIAC FOSSA.   CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: COMPARISON STUDY 19/12/13.  POST CONTRAST PORTAL VENOUS PHASE STUDY PERFORMED.   MARKED MURAL OEDEMA AND WALL THICKENING NOTED IN THE CAECUM AND PROXIMAL  ASCENDING COLON AS WELL AS THE TERMINAL ILEUM WITHOUT ASSOCIATED  OBSTRUCTION. ADJACENT MESENTERIC STRANDING WITH A TRACE AMOUNT OF FREE  FLUID.  NO INTRAABDOMINAL COLLECTION, ATROPHIC GAS OR OTHER FEATURES TO  SUGGEST PERFORATION.  NO WALL THICKENING NOTED IN THE REMAINDER OF THE SMALL  OR LARGE BOWEL WHICH IS OTHERWISE OF NORMAL CALIBRE.  NO PATHOLOGICAL  INTRAABDOMINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY.    NOTING STABLE BILATERAL RENAL CYSTS, NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT ABDOMINAL  PATHOLOGY IS SEEN. HEAVY AORTOILIAC CALCIFICATION WITH SUSPECTED HIGH  GRADE BUT NARROWING OF THE PROXIMAL SMA FROM ITS ORIGINS WITH A DEGREE OF  POST STERNOTIC DILATATION BUT PRESERVED ENHANCEMENT DISTALLY, ALLOWING FOR  THE VENOUS PHASE STUDY.    THE APPENDIX IS IDENTIFIED INFERIOR TO THE CAECUM, MILDLY PROMINENT IN  DIAMETER AT ITS TIP (APPROXIMATELY 7MM) BUT WITH GAS NOTED WITHIN THE  APPENDICEAL TIP AND NORMAL CALIBRE IN ITS MID SEGMENT (APPROXIMATELY 6MM).    RIGHT BASAL LUNG CHANGES ARE IN KEEPING WITH KNOWN HISTORY OF RIGHT LOWER  LOBECTOMY AND LUNG MALIGNANCY.  OVERALL APPEARANCES ARE THOUGHT TO BE  COMPARABLE TO PREVIOUS SCAN DATED 4/4/2014.  NO SINISTER BONE LESIONS  CONVINCINGLY IDENTIFIED.   COMMENT:   IN THE CONTEXT OF KNOWN RECENT CHEMOTHERAPY AND ACUTE ONSET ABDOMINAL PAIN,  APPEARANCES ARE FAVOURED TO REFLECT PROXIMAL COLITIS/CAECITIS AND TERMINAL  ILIITIS. IN THE CONTEXT OF RECENT CHEMOTHERAPY, TYPHLITIS REQUIRES  CONSIDERATION. NO EVIDENCE OF PERFORATION, ABSCESS FORMATION OR  OBSTRUCTION.

15R069161,"CLINICAL:   L1/L2 TB SPINE WITH GROSS DEFORMITY DIAGNOSED IN MAY 2014 WITH PARALYSIS  PARAPARESIS.    TECHNIQUE:  PORTAL VENOUS CONTRAST ABDOMEN PELVIS.   REPORT: NO PREVIOUS IMAGING IS AVAILABLE FOR COMPARISON AT TIME OF REPORT.    CT ABDOMEN:  WITHIN SEGMENT 8 OF THE LIVER THERE IS A HYPERDENSE TRACT WHICH LIKELY  REPRESENTS A SIMPLE CYST OR ?OLD TRAUMA. BOTH ADRENALS, THE RIGHT KIDNEY, PANCREAS AND THE SPLEEN ARE UNREMARKABLE. THERE IS AN ENHANCING MASS WITHIN THE ANTEROLATERAL CORTEX OF THE LEFT KIDNEY WHICH IS OF FAT DENSITY AND LIKELY REPRESENTS AN ANGIOLIOLIPOMA. GALL BLADDER AND HEPATIC DUCT ARE NORMAL.  THE LARGE BOWEL IS UNREMARKABLE.  THE SMALL BOWEL IS GENERALLY FLUID FILLED AND WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.  THERE IS SOME MILD CONGESTION IN THE MESENTERY HOWEVER NO SURROUNDING FAT STRANDING.  THERE IS MULTIPLE SUB CENTRE LYMPH NODES WITHIN THE PELVIS, THE LARGEST LYMPH NODE MEASURING 15MM IN NON AXIS DIMENSIONS ADJACENT TO THE LEFT ILEUM WHICH IS LIKELY REACTIVE IN NATURE.    THERE ARE BILATERAL HYPODENSE ENCAPSULATED MASSES EXTENDING THROUGH BOTH  PSOAS MUSCLES FROM THE LEVEL OF L1.  THERE IS CALCIFICATION THROUGH THESE ENCAPSULATED STRUCTURES WHICH IS INTIMATELY RELATED TO THE L1 AND L2 VERTEBRA WHICH HAVE UNDERGONE PATHOLOGICAL DESTRUCTION WITH GROSS LOSS OF BONE VOLUME (PLEASE REFER TO SPINE REPORT).  THE VISUALISED BONY PELVIS IS UNREMARKABLE.  AORTIC VASCULATURE IS NORMAL.  THERE ARE NO HERNIAS. THORACOLUMBAR SPINE:   THERE IS GROSS BONY DESTRUCTION INVOLVING THE L1 AND L2 VERTEBRA WITH LOSS  OF THE INFERIOR ASPECT OF THE L1 VERTEBRAL BODY AND LOSS OF THE SUPERIOR  ASPECT OF THE L2 VERTEBRAL BODY.    T12/L1:   NO FORAMINAL NARROWING. THERE IS NO SPINAL CANAL STENOSIS.    L1/L2: THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION OF THE SPINAL CANAL WITH RETRUSION OF  VERTEBRAL BODY FRAGMENTS POSTERIORLY.  THERE IS SEVERE LEFT SIDED FORAMINAL NARROWING.    L2/L3: SUPERIORLY THESE IS SEVERE BROAD BASED DISC BULGE CAUSING EFFACEMENT  OF THE SPINAL CORD.  BOTH FORAMINAL OPENINGS ARE OF NORMAL CALIBRE.    INFERIOR AND TO THIS THE L3/4 L4/5 L5/S1 THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A DISC  BULGE.  NEURAL EXIT FORAMINA ARE OF NORMAL CALIBRE. THERE ARE TWO LYTIC  LESIONS INVOLVING THE T12 VERTEBRAL BODY ANTERIORLY AND LEFT LATERALLY.  THERE IS NO OTHER DESTRUCTIVE BONY LESION SEEN THROUGH THE LUMBAR SPINE.    COMMENT:  THERE IS EVIDENCE OF DESTRUCTION OF THE L1/2 AND VERTEBRAL BODIES, LUCENT  LESIONS ALSO PRESENT WITHIN THE T12 VERTEBRAL BODY WITH ASSOCIATED BILATERAL  PSOAS ABSCESS WITH CALCIFICATION WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF TUBERCULOUS  PARASPINAL ABSCESS.

RULE OUT  OTHER PATHOLOGY. REPORT:   POST-IV CONTRAST CT, PORTAL VENOUS PHASE.  COMPARISON ULTRASOUND 24/7/15.  THERE IS NO FREE INTRAPERITONEAL GAS.  THERE  IS A SMALL VOLUME OF FLUID IN THE LEFT ADNEXAL REGION AND POUCH OF DOUGLAS.   THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME PERITONEAL ENHANCEMENT IN THIS REGION.  IN THE  REGION OF THE LEFT OVARY THERE IS A CYSTIC STRUCTURE MEASURING 19M DIAMETER  COMPATIBLE WITH THE CYST/CORPUS LUTEUM SEEN ON RECENT PELVIC ULTRASOUNDS.  THERE IS NO HYDROSALPINX.  THE RIGHT OVARY APPEARS UNREMARKABLE.  THE UTERUS  IS ANTEVERTED. NO FLUID WITHIN THE ENDOMETRIAL CAVITY.  THERE ARE NO DILATED LOOPS OF BOWEL.  APPENDIX IS SURGICALLY ABSENT.     TERMINAL ILEUM APPEARS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.  THE LIVER IS NOT ENLARGED.  THERE IS BACKGROUND STEATOSIS PREDOMINANTLY  INVOLVING THE RIGHT LOBE AS DEMONSTRATED ON THE RECENT ULTRASOUND.  THERE IS  A HYPOATTENUATING, LOBULATED LESION IN SUBCAPSULAR SEGMENT 4B WHICH PRODUCES  A SLIGHTLY BULGE IN THE LIVER CAPSULE.  THIS IS ADJACENT TO THE FALCIFORM  LIGAMENT.  ITS LOCATION AND THE PRESENCE OF VESSELS COURSING THROUGH THE  LESION WOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH FOCAL FATTY DEPOSITION.  THE HISTORY OF  RECENT APPENDICECTOMY IS NOTED.   AN INFLAMMATORY LESION WITHIN THE LIVER  REMAINS A POSSIBILITY BUT IS FELT LESS LIKELY GIVEN THIS IS A SOLITARY  LESION.  FURTHER CHARACTERISATION BY ULTRASOUND IS SUGGESTED IN THE FIRST  INSTANCE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS REGION WAS NOT SEEN WHILE ON THE SAVED  ULTRASOUND IMAGES OF 24/7/15.  THE ADRENALS, KIDNEYS, SPLEEN AND PANCREAS APPEAR WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.   MAJOR MESENTERIC VESSELS NORMAL OPACIFIED WITH CONTRAST.    TINY LOCULE OF GAS WITHIN THE BLADDER MAY BE SECONDARY TO RECENT  CATHETERISATION, CLINICAL CORRELATION REQUIRED.  LUNG BASES ARE CLEAR.   COMMENT:   SMALL AMOUNT OF FREE FLUID IN THE LEFT ADNEXAL REGION DEMONSTRATES SUBTLE  ENHANCEMENT.  NO WELL FORMED ABSCESS COLLECTION IS IDENTIFIED.  CYSTIC  STRUCTURE WITHIN THE LEFT OVARY HAS BEEN SEEN ON PREVIOUS ULTRASOUND,   COMPATIBLE WITH SIMPLE CYST OR CORPUS LUTEUM.  NO HYDROSALPINX.    INDETERMINATE HYPOINTENSE LESION IN SEGMENT 4B.  LIVER ABSCESS IS FELT LESS  LIKELY BUT FURTHER CHARACTERISATION BY TARGETED ULTRASOUND RECOMMENDED IN  THE FIRST INSTANCE.  FINDINGS CONVEYED TO THE ASU TEAM.
