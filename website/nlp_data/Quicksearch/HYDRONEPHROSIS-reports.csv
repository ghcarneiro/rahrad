REPORT: ONCE AGAIN, A MULTILOCULATED COLLECTION IS SEEN WITHIN THE PELVIS, ABUTTING THE SUPERIOR ASPECT AND LEFT SIDE OF THE BLADDER, AND LYING BETWEEN BOWEL LOOPS.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY MEASURE DUE TO ITS MULTILOCULATED NATURE, BUT ITS MAXIMAL DIMENSIONS ARE 11.6CM AP X 7.5CM TRANSVERSE X 8.5CM CC.

OVERALL SIZE OF THE PERITONEAL DEPOSITS APPEARS SLIGHTLY MORE PROMINENT FROM  PREVIOUS, ALLOWING FOR LIMITED ACCURACY OF MEASUREMENTS DUE TO IRREGULAR,  LOBULATED NATURE OF THE LESIONS.    MULTIPLE LIVER LESIONS ARE ALSO DEMONSTRATED, WITH A CENTRALLY  CYSTIC/NECROTIC APPEARANCE TO A LARGE SEGMENT 4B/5 LESION IN THE INFERIOR  RIGHT HEMILIVER WHICH HAS INCREASED IN SIZE FROM PREVIOUS (CURRENT MAXIMAL  AXIAL DIMENSIONS APPROXIMATELY 52MM, PREVIOUSLY 44MM).

SIGNIFICANT MASS EFFECT OVER THE PELVIC MASSES ON THE ADJACENT BOWEL, WITH INTIMATE ASSOCIATION OF THE PELVIC SOFT TISSUE MASS WITH THE ADJACENT SIGMOID, WHICH APPEARS THICK WALLED EVEN ALLOWING FOR ITS COLLAPSE. THERE IS  ALSO THE APPEARANCE OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE SIGMOID LUMEN AND PELVIC  MASS LESION INTERNALLY. THE LESION DEMONSTRATED INTERVAL CAVITATION IN THIS  REGION WITH ECTOPIC GAS LOCULES, CONCERNING FOR A PASSAGE OF BOWEL GAS/CONTENTS INTO THE MASS LESION WITH A SUBSEQUENT INTRA LESIONAL COLLECTION.

NO OVERT BOWEL DILATATION IS  SEEN TO SUGGEST AN ESTABLISHED COMPLETE OBSTRUCTION HOWEVER THE  AFOREMENTIONED MASS EFFECT OF THE PELVIC MASS ON THE ADJACENT SMALL AND  LARGE BOWEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH FAECALISATION WITHIN PROMINENT SMALL BOWEL  LOOPS IN THE ANTERIOR PELVIS WHICH DOES SUGGEST A DEGREE OF FUNCTIONAL  OBSTRUCTION.

MILDLY  DILATED FLUID FILLED SMALL BOWEL LOOPS MAY INDICATE DISMOTILITY ALTHOUGH IT  IS DIFFICULT TO ENTIRELY EXCLUDE AN EARLY SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.
