COMPARISON STUDY:   CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 28/7/2009.   REPORT: THERE IS A MODERATE VOLUME OF FREE GAS PROMINENTLY IN THE RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT.  WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR STUDY, THIS HAS REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY.   THE ILEOCOLIC ANASTOMOSIS ITSELF HAS A SIMILAR APPEARANCE, HOWEVER THE   ADJACENT COLLECTION CONTAINING GAS AND FLUID NOW APPEARS MORE ORGANISED WITH  AN ESTABLISHED ENHANCING RIM.

THERE HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE LEFT SIDED PELVIC MASS WHEN COMPARED TO THE STUDY FROM JUST OVER ONE MONTH AGO.  THERE IS NO COMPLETE OBSTRUCTION OF THE DISTAL PORTION OF THE DESCENDING COLON.  THE TISSUE PLANES HAVE BEEN OBLITERATED AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ASSESS WHETHER  THE MASS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY COMPRESSED OR DIRECTLY INVADED THE BOWEL ALTHOUGH  IT IS LIKELY A COMBINATION OF BOTH.  AS A RESULT OF THE OBSTRUCTION, THERE  IS SIGNIFICANT DILATATION OF THE PROXIMAL LARGE BOWEL. THE CAECAL DIAMETER  IS MEASURED AT 9.2CM.  THE BOWEL WALL APPEARS TO ENHANCE NORMALLY WITH NO  EVIDENCE OF PNEUMATOSIS AND THERE IS OTHERWISE NO OBVIOUS EVIDENCE OF BOWEL  INVOLVEMENT.

ALTHOUGH ORAL CONTRAST WAS ADMINISTERED,  THE PATIENT WAS UNABLE TO TOLERATE IT DUE TO VOMITING. NO PREVIOUS IMAGING  AVAILABLE FOR COMPARISON. THERE IS EVIDENCE OF PREVIOUS RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY, WITH AN ANASTOMOSIS BETWEEN THE ILEUM AND TRANSVERSE COLON IN THE RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT. PROXIMAL TO THE ANASTOMOSIS THERE IS DILATATION OF FLUID FILLED LOOPS OF SMALL BOWEL, SEVERAL OF WHICH CONTAIN AIR/FLUID LEVELS. THE STOMACH IS ALSO DILATED AND FLUID FILLED.  THE DUODENUM AND PROXIMAL JEJUNUM ARE LESS PROMINENT.   DISTAL TO THE ANASTOMOSIS TRANSVERSE COLON IS PRIMARILY FILLED WITH AIR  AND THERE IS SOME FLUID SEEN WITHIN THE DISTAL SIGMOID AND RECTUM.   APPEARANCES ARE NOT CONVINCING FOR A MECHANICAL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION, DUE TO  THE NON-DILATED LOOPS OF JEJUNUM AND THE MILD DISTENSION WITH GAS AND FLUID  OF THE LARGE BOWEL.  DIFFERENTIALS INCLUDE BOWEL ISCHAEMIA, INFLAMMATION,  OR EARLY / INCOMPLETE BOWEL OBSTRUCTION AT THE LEVEL OF THE ANASTOMOSIS.   THERE IS NO DRAINABLE COLLECTION PRESENT. THERE IS GENERALISED MESENTERIC PROMINENT STRANDING WITH MULTIPLE SMALL NODULES IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE MESENTERY. JUST SUPERIOR AND POSTERIOR TO THE SITE OF THE ANASTOMOSIS THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SMALL LOCULES OF GAS WHICH ARE  NOT WITHIN BOWEL LUMEN, AND APPEARANCES ARE SUSPICIOUS FOR LOCALISED PERFORATION, POSSIBLY AT THE SITE OF ANASTOMOSIS.  HOWEVER, COMPARISON WITH ANY PREVIOUS IMAGING IS RECOMMENDED TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS A NEW FINDING. THE BOWEL WALL ENHANCES NORMALLY WITH CONTRAST AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF PNEUMATOSIS OR INFARCTION. WHILST DIFFICULT TO ASSESS IN UNPREPARED BOWEL, TUMOUR RECURRENCE AT THE SITE OF ANASTOMOSIS IS A POSSIBILITY.   THERE IS NO PATHOLOGICAL LYMPHADENOPATHY IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE ABDOMEN OR  PELVIS. THE LIVER APPEARS UNREMARKABLE. THE LUNG BASES ARE CLEAR. THERE IS ABNORMAL INCREASED DENSITY INVOLVING THE LEFT HEMIPELVIS. IT IS QUITE DIFFUSE WITH BOTH CORTICAL AND TRABECULAR THICKENING AND EXPANION OF THE BONE, AND APPEARANCES ARE CONSISTENT WITH PAGET'S DISEASE. NO DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE OF BONY MALIGNANCY OR ACUTE BONY ABNORMALITY.    CONCLUSION: ABNORMALLY DILATED LOOPS OF MID TO DISTAL SMALL BOWEL.  DIFFERENTIALS FOR SUCH AN APPEARANCE INCLUDE ISCHAEMIA, INFLAMMATION, OR EARLY / INCOMPLETE BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.   TINY LOCULES OF EXTRA LUMINAL GAS RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCALISED  PERFORATION AROUND THE ANASTOMOTIC SITE.   NO DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC DISEASE.

THERE IS AN END TRANSVERSE COLECTOMY. THE HERNIATED BOWEL  LOOP INVOLVES THE MORE PROXIMAL TRANSVERSE COLON. WITHIN THE HERNIAL SAC THE  TRANSVERSE COLON IS MODERATELY DISTENDED WITH FAECAL RESIDUE.  THE DISTAL  BOWEL WHICH PASSES BACK THROUGH THE DEFECT TO THE SKIN IS COLLAPSED,  SUGGESTING THERE IS A DEGREE OF OBSTRUCTION HERE. THERE IS BOWEL WALL  THICKENING AND HYPERENHANCEMENT SUGGESTING THAT THE BOWEL IS INFLAMED AND  CONGESTED.  THERE IS STRANDING OF THE SUPERFICIAL FAT SURROUNDING THE HERNIA  AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA LUMINAL FLUID SEEN LATERALLY MEASURING 27 X 13MM  (AP, TRANS).
