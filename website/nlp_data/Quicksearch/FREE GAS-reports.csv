FULLNESS OF BILIARY TREE WAS MORE  PROMINENT THAN ON 16/6/15, UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE.  MILD CORTICAL  IRREGULARITY IN EACH KIDNEY WAS NOTED WITH LEFT RENAL CYST EVIDENT.  URINE DISTENDED BLADDER WAS SEEN.    THERE WAS BILATERAL BASAL LUNG ATELECTASIS, PARTICULARLY IN RIGHT LOWER  LOBE.   MILD TO MODERATE RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION WAS VISIBLE. CONCLUSION:   NEW FREE GAS IN KEEPING WITH PERFORATED VISCUS.  MILD INFLAMMATORY CHANGE IN  RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT.  SITE OF PERFORATION WAS NOT CLEAR, POSSIBLY COULD  RELATE TO ULCERATION OF DISTAL STOMACH OR DUODENUM OR POSSIBLY IN RELATION TO  DIVERTICULITIS OF HEPATIC FLEXURE.  REPORTED BY DR J SYKES ",Free gas
15R073818,"CLINICAL:   METASTATIC SCC UNKNOWN ORIGIN RESULTING IN LARGE BOWEL OBSTRUCTION REQUIRING  LAPAROTOMY, HARTMANN'S PROCEDURE AND RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY AND PARTIAL  CYSTECTOMY.  FEBRILE FOR SEVERAL DAYS ?ABDOMINAL SOURCE ?ANASTOMOTIC LEAK OR  COLLECTION.   CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:    BOWEL: ANASTOMOTIC STAPLE LYING IN THE RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT RELATED TO THE RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY APPEARS APPROPRIATE.  THE ADDITIONAL STAPLE LINE  WITHIN THE PELVIS ALSO APPEARS NORMAL.  THERE IS NO COLLECTION SEEN  SURROUNDING EITHER OF THESE STAPLE LINES NOR REGIONAL FREE GAS.  THE  COLOSTOMY APPEARS APPROPRIATE.  SOME PROMINENCE OF THE VASO RECTA ALTHOUGH  IS QUITE ACCEPTABLE FOR THE POST OPERATIVE STATE.  THERE IS ALSO SOME MILD  FAT STRANDING FAVOURED AS RELATED TO SURGICAL MOBILISATION WITHIN THE RIGHT MID ABDOMEN JUST POSTERIOR TO THE ANASTOMOSIS.  SMALL REGIONAL OMENTAL INFARCT ALSO POSSIBLE.  NO CONCERNING REGIONAL FEATURES.     OTHER FINDINGS:   LIVER, SPLEEN, PANCREAS, ADRENALS AND KIDNEYS APPEAR APPROPRIATE. THERE IS  SOME FOCAL FAT INFILTRATION AROUND THE FALCIFORM LIGAMENT.  THERE IS SOME  GAS WITHIN THE BLADDER WHICH IS PRESUMED IATROGENIC.  MILD VASCULAR  CALCIFICATION. THERE IS SOME FAT STRANDING AND DEBRIS IN THE REGION OF THE  MIDLINE LAPAROTOMY WITH THE WOUND APPEARING MORE OPEN AROUND THE LEVEL OF  THE UMBILICUS.  SLICES THROUGH LUNG BASES ARE CLEAR.  NO SIGNIFICANT BONY  PATHOLOGY.   COMMENT:   ACCEPTABLE POST OPERATIVE APPEARANCES.  THE ANASTOMOTIC STAPLE LINE WITHIN  THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ABDOMEN AND THE DEFUNCTIONED LARGE BOWEL STAPLE LINE  IN THE PELVIS ALL APPEAR APPROPRIATE WITH ANTICIPATED REGIONAL FAT  STRANDING AND POST SURGICAL CHANGES.  THERE IS NO COLLECTION, FREE GAS OR  OTHER IMAGING FEATURE OF CONCERN.  NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT FINDING.    REPORTED BY DR S KNOX",Free gas
15R080259,"CLINICAL:   35 YEAR OLD MALE STAB TO THE ABDOMEN.  PANCREATIC LACERATION AND BILE LEAK.   LIVER LAC.     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:   CT ABDOMEN WITH PRE AND POST CONTRAST IMAGES.  NO PREVIOUS FOR COMPARISON.  THERE IS AN NGT IN SITU WITH TIP WITHIN THE BODY OF THE STOMACH.  THERE IS A  RIGHT SIDED DRAIN WITHIN THE PANCREATIC BED.  THERE IS A LACERATION THROUGH  SEGMENT 2/3 OF THE LIVER WITH SURROUNDING FLUID. THERE IS ALSO A LACERATION THROUGH THE NECK/BODY OF THE PANCREAS.  THE ARTERIAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE PANCREAS IS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS WITH NO OBVIOUS PANCREATIC NECROSIS. SMALL  SPLENUNCULUS NOTED AT THE TAIL OF THE PANCREAS.    ARTERIAL PHASE IMAGING SHOWS SLIGHT ANOMALY OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM WITH THE  LEFT GASTRIC ARTERY DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE AORTA.  INFERIOR TO THIS THERE  IS A NORMAL CELIAC TRUNK WITH A LARGE COMMON HEPATIC ARTERY AND AN  ATTENUATED SPLENIC ARTERY (PREVIOUS SPLENECTOMY NOTED).  THE SMA IS PATENT  WITH A NORMAL MORPHOLOGY AND IS TO THE LEFT OF THE SMV.  THE INFERIOR  MESENTERIC ARTERY IS ALSO PATENT AND IS SEEN TO BRANCH FROM THE ABDOMINAL  AORTA AT APPROXIMATELY L3 LEVEL.    THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE STOMACH, SMALL BOWEL AND LARGE BOWEL APPEARS WITHIN  NORMAL LIMITS.  CHOLELITHIASIS WITH NO OBVIOUS COMPLICATION IS NOTED. THERE  IS FREE FLUID AND FREE GAS WITHIN THE ABDOMEN IN KEEPING WITH THE RECENT  INTERVENTION.  NO OBVIOUS BONY INJURY IS IDENTIFIED. THERE IS BIBASAL  COLLAPSE/CONSOLIDATION WITH PLEURAL EFFUSION (LEFT GREATER THAN RIGHT)  NOTED IN LUNG BASES.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA IS SEEN  ANTERIORLY AND IN THE LEFT HEMITHORAX. POST CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT OF THE KIDNEYS IS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.  THERE IS AN IDC WITHIN THE BLADDER.   CONCLUSION:   NO OBVIOUS VASCULAR INJURY IS IDENTIFIED.  THERE IS A LACERATION THROUGH  SEGMENT 2/3 OF THE LIVER WITH SURROUNDING ASCITES/FREE FLUID.  THERE IS A  LACERATION THROUGH THE NECK/BODY OF THE PANCREAS WHICH WARRANTS FURTHER  INVESTIGATION WITH ERCP TO EXCLUDE LEAK INTO THE ABDOMEN.  FREE GAS AND FREE  FLUID IN THE ABDOMEN IN KEEPING WITH LAPAROTOMY.  NO OBVIOUS INJURY TO THE  STOMACH, SMALL BOWEL, LARGE BOWEL, KIDNEYS OR PELVIC ORGANS.  BIBASAL  CONSOLIDATION WITH EFFUSION NOTED WITHIN THE LUNGS. INCIDENTAL NOTE OF  CHOLELITHIASIS. REPORTED BY DR C ASTILL (GR) REVIEWED BY DR G RUSH ",Free gas
