03R017183,"CT ABDOMEN AND CT HEAD   CLINICAL INFORMATION: DISTENDED ABDOMEN, METABOLIC ACID DOSES, DECREASED HAEMOGLOBIN  TECHNIQUE: POST CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN. PRE CONTRAST CT HEAD BASE OF SKULL TO VERTEX.  REPORT: HEAD: COMPARISON MADE WITH THE PREVIOUS EXAMINATION OF 28/2/02. THE  INTRACEREBRAL HAEMORRHAGE WITHIN THE LEFT CEREBRAL CORTEX HAS DECREASED IN  SIZE, HOWEVER THE SURROUNDING HYPODENSITY IS MUCH ENLARGED.  THE MIDLINE IS  SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT SIDE APPROXIMATELY 2 CM. THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH  DILATATION OF THE RIGHT LATERAL VENTRICLE. THE SUBARACHNOID BLOOD IN THE  VERTEX HAS RESOLVED SOMEWHAT COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS FILMS.  NOTE IS MADE  OF THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY ANEURYSM CLIP.   ABDOMEN: WITHIN THE ABDOMEN THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DILATATION OF SMALL BOWEL  ASSOCIATED WITH AIR FLUID LEVELS AND THE IMPRESSION OF THICKENING OF THE  SMALL BOWEL WALL. THE SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY IS FOUND TO BE PATENT IN  ITS PROXIMAL COURSE. THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE A CHANGE OF CALIBRE WITHIN THE  SMALL BOWEL WITH THE DISTAL ILEUM APPEARING NORMAL IN CALIBRE. THE LIVER,  SPLEEN AND PANCREAS APPEAR NORMAL. NO ADRENAL ABNORMALITY IDENTIFIED. THERE  IS A SIMPLE CYST WITHIN THE RIGHT KIDNEY. THE KIDNEYS ARE OTHERWISE  UNREMARKABLE. WITHIN THE PELVIS THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF  FREE FLUID AND THE PRESENCE OF A URINARY CATHETER IS NOTED. THE LUNG BASES  SHOW BILATERAL BASAL CONSOLIDATION CHANGES.    COMMENT:  THE OVERALL IMPRESSION IS OF A PARTIAL SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION. GIVEN THE  CLINICAL HISTORY, EARLY MESENTERIC ISCHAEMIA MUST BE RAISED AS A  POSSIBILITY.  ",Mesenteric ischaemia
12R048922,"THERE HAS BEEN AN AMENDMENT TO THE INTERIM REPORT, SEE ADDENDUM.   CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS      CLINICAL:   DIFFUSE ABDOMINAL PAIN AND TENDERNESS. FEBRILE ON ARRIVAL. NO OBVIOUS  PRIMARY. NIL CHANGE IN BOWEL HABIT. ? ISCHAEMIC GUT.    FINDINGS:   NO COMPARISON IMAGING. POST INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS IN  ARTERIAL PHASE ONLY PERFORMED.   THERE IS NO FREE INTRAPERITONEAL GAS OR ASCITES. THE AORTA IS OF NORMAL  CALIBRE. THERE IS MODERATE ATHEROMATOUS PLAQUE BUT NO EVIDENCE OF  SIGNIFICANT STENOSIS. THE COELIAC TRUNK, SMA AND IMA ARE WELL OPACIFIED WITH  CONTRAST. THE PORTAL VEIN AND SMV APPEAR OF GROSSLY NORMAL CALIBRE BUT  CANNOT BE FURTHER ASSESSED ON ARTERIAL PHASE. THE LIVER, GALLBLADDER,  SPLEEN, ADRENALS, PANCREAS APPEAR WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS. AN EXOPHYTIC SIMPLE  CYST NOTED AT THE INFERIOR POLE OF THE RIGHT KIDNEY. NO EVIDENCE OF HYDRONEPHROSIS. MULTIPLE ROUND FLUID DENSITY STRUCTURES APPEAR TO ARISE FROM THE BLADDER IN KEEPING WITH BLADDER DIVERTICULA ALTHOUGH THERE IS SIGNIFICANT BEAM HARDENING ARTIFACT FROM RIGHT TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT. THE PROSTATE DOES NOT APPEAR SIGNIFICANTLY ENLARGED. THE LARGEST DIVERTICULA IS IN THE LEFT POSTEROLATERAL REGION MEASURING 42MM DIAMETER. THERE IS NO HYDROURETER.   EXTENSIVE SIGMOID DIVERTICULA IS PRESENT WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF ACUTE  INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATION. THE APPENDIX IS DIFFICULT TO VISUALISE BUT THERE  IS NO INFLAMMATORY CHANGE WITHIN THE RIGHT ILIAC FOSSA MESENTERY.  TERMINAL  ILEUM APPEARS UNREMARKABLE. THE HERNIAL ORIFICES ARE CLEAR.   THERE IS CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE DEPENDENT RIGHT LOWER LOBE WHICH MAY  ACCOUNT FOR THE PATIENT'S FEVER. THE POSSIBILITY OF ASPIRATION SHOULD BE  CONSIDERED.    CONCLUSION:   NO ACUTE INTRAABDOMINAL PATHOLOGY EVIDENT ON ARTERIAL PHASE IMAGING. THE  MAJOR MESENTERIC ARTERIES OPACIFY WELL WITH CONTRAST, NONETHELESS  CORRELATION WITH CLINICAL RISK FACTORS OR MESENTERIC ISCHAEMIA IS WARRANTED.  THERE IS CONSOLIDATION IN THE RIGHT LUNG BASE WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE  PATIENT'S FEVER. ASPIRATION WARRANTS CONSIDERATION.  ADDENDUM:  VIEWS OF THE SIGMOID COLON ARE SUBOPTIMAL DUE TO ARTEFACT.  THERE  IS SUSPICION OF MINOR STRANDING SURROUNDING THE SIGMOID COLON WHICH MAY  RELATE TO DIVERTICULITIS.  NO COLLECTION OR PERFORATION SEEN.  CLINICAL  CORRELATION WARRANTED.

CT ABDOMEN:    TECHNIQUE:   FOLLOWING DISCUSSION WITH THE REFERRING AS THERE WAS CONCERN REGARDING  POSSIBLE MESENTERIC ISCHAEMIA, ACT ANGIOGRAM AND PORTAL VENOUS PHASE STUDY  WAS PERFORMED.   VASCULAR:   THERE IS HEAVY ATHEROMATOUS DISEASE OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA AND THERE IS  EVIDENCE OF AORTOBIILIAC OVERLAY AND BYPASS GRAFT WHICH IS PATENT.  THE  NATIVE RIGHT COMMON ILIAC AND LEFT EXTERNAL ARTERIES ARE OCCLUDED.  OF NOTE THERE IS EVIDENCE OF LONG SEGMENT ACUTE THROMBUS WITHIN THE SMA  ARTERY ARISING FROM ITS ORIGIN EXTENDING OVER A DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY  3CM.  THE VESSEL IS OPACIFIED DISTALLY WHICH IS LIKELY RELATED TO COLLATERAL  SUPPLY.  THERE IS HEAVY CALCIFICATION OF THE RENAL ARTERY ORIGINS ALTHOUGH  THE VESSELS REMAIN PATENT.  THE COELIAC ARTERY ORIGIN IS PATENT.   GIT:   THERE IS ABNORMAL DILATATION OF SMALL BOWEL WITHOUT TRANSITION POINT  DEMONSTRATED. SMALL BOWEL RETAINS NORMAL MUCOSAL ENHANCEMENT AND THERE IS  NO ABNORMAL THICKENING. THERE IS NO FREE GAS TO SUGGEST HOLLOW VISCUS  PERFORATION AND NO PNEUMATOSIS IDENTIFIED.
