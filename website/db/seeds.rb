THE WALLS OF THE DISTAL ILEUM FORMING THE STOMA  ARE THICKENED, BUT ORAL CONTRAST IS SEEN FLOWING THROUGHOUT THE SMALL BOWEL  LOOPS AND INTO THE BACK.  SLIGHTLY MORE PROXIMALLY, THERE IS PROMINENCE OF  THE SMALL BOWEL LOOPS MEASURING UP TO 3.2CM.  THIS COULD REFLECT A DEGREE OF  OUTFLOW OBSTRUCTION, BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF FRANK OBSTRUCTION.  THERE IS A DRAIN WITHIN THE LOWER ABDOMINAL CAVITY.  THE PERITONEAL LINING  IS THICKENED AND ENHANCING THROUGHOUT, UNCHANGED IN APPEARANCE FROM THE  PREVIOUS STUDY.  SMALL LOCULES OF PNEUMOPERITONEUM CONSISTENT WITH RECENT  SURGICAL INTERVENTION. OVERALL, THE AMOUNT OF ASCITES AND PNEUMOPERITONEUM  HAS DECREASED. ALLOWING FOR THE LARGE AMOUNT OF ASCITES, THERE IS NO  INTRA-ABDOMINAL COLLECTION.   THERE ARE MULTIPLE RADIO-OPAQUE GALLSTONES IN A SLIGHTLY DISTENDED  GALLBLADDER, BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS. NO EVIDENCE  OF BILIARY TRACT OBSTRUCTION.  THE LIVER, SPLEEN, KIDNEYS, ADRENALS AND PANCREAS ARE UNREMARKABLE.   CONCLUSION:   EXTENSIVE INFLAMMATORY CHANGE THROUGHOUT BOTH LUNGS CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN POST-OPERATIVE ARDS.  NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLUS.  MODERATE BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS.  ASCITES THROUGHOUT THE ABDOMEN, SLIGHTLY REDUCED IN VOLUME FROM PREVIOUS.    PROMINENT SMALL BOWEL LOOPS.  ALTHOUGH LESS DISTENDED THAN PREVIOUS, THIS  COULD STILL REFLECT A DEGREE OF OUTFLOW IMPAIRMENT OR POST-OPERATIVE ILEUS.  CONTRAST PASSES THROUGH TO THE ILEOSTOMY BAG.  SEVERE THICKENING OF THE SMALL BOWEL WALLS DISTALLY. APPEARANCES ARE  NON-SPECIFIC BUT COULD REPRESENT INFLAMMATORY/INFECTIVE/POST-OPERATIVE  CHANGES.  ENHANCING PERITONEAL WALLS CONSISTENT WITH PERITONITIS.  REPORTED BY DR J LAM (SM) REVIEWED BY DR J BUCKLEY ", end_dx_id: keydx_12.id, times_attempted: 0, correct_diagnosis: 0, difficulty: 0)

SOURCE OF PERFORATION. REPORT:   THERE IS EXTENSIVE FREE GAS, LOCULES OF GAS ARE SEEN IN THE MESENTERY,  INCLUDING SEVERAL SMALL LOCULES OF GAS IN THE LESSER SAC. THERE IS EXTENSIVE STRANDING IN THE LEFT LOWER QUADRANT, THIS IS ADJACENT PREVIOUS HERNIA REPAIR.  THERE IS ASSOCIATED BOWEL WALL THICKENING OF THE PROXIMAL SIGMOID WITH AN AREA OF APPARENT STENOSIS IN THIS REGION. ADJACENT THIS IN THE MIDLINE OVER THE TOP OF THE BLADDER IS A WALLED OFF AREA CONTAINING FAECAL MATERIAL, COMPATIBLE WITH A COLLECTION/PERFORATION. FINDINGS MOST LIKELY REPRESENT DIVERTICULAR PERFORATION, ALTHOUGH THE NARROWING OF THE SIGMOID ALONG WITH WALL THICKENING AND PATIENT AGE COULD SUGGEST A MALIGNANT STRICTURE AND PERFORATION ALSO.    THE SMALL BOWEL IS DISTENDED IN THE MID TO UPPER ABDOMEN, NO FOCAL  TRANSITION POINT IS SEEN. FINDINGS LIKELY REPRESENT AN ILEUS IN THE SETTING  OF FAECAL PERITONITIS. THERE IS A LARGE GALLSTONE.  MULTIPLE KIDNEY CYSTS.  MULTIPLE HEPATIC HYPODENSITY LIKELY REPRESENTING CYSTS, THESE COULD BE FURTHER ASSESSED WITH ULTRASOUND IN THE NON URGENT SETTING.    THERE IS BASAL ATELECTASIS IN THE LUNGS, OTHERWISE GENERALLY WELL AERATED.   NO DESTRUCTIVE BONY LESION. COMMENT:   BOWEL WALL THICKENING WITH PERFORATION AND COLLECTION IN THE LEFT LOWER  QUADRANT AT THE PROXIMAL SIGMOID.  PROBABLY DUE TO DIVERTICULITIS, A  MALIGNANT STRICTURE AND PERFORATION REMAINS A DIFFERENTIAL.    SMALL BOWEL DISTENSION LIKELY DUE TO ILEUS SECONDARY TO FAECAL PERITONITIS.

THERE ARE NUMEROUS THICKENED LOOPS OF SMALL BOWEL WITHIN THE LEFT SIDE OF  THE ABDOMEN PRESUMABLY REACTIVE IN NATURE.  THERE ARE TINY LOCULES OF PERIPHERAL GAS - I SUSPECT THESE RELATE TO GAS BETWEEN THE SMALL BOWEL FOLDS, RATHER THAN PNEUMATOSIS THOUGH THIS IS DIFFICULT TO ENTIRELY EXCLUDE.
