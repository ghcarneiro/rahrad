1. Run python create-seed.py to generate the list of diagnoses to put into seeds.rb (Categories 1, 2 and 3)
2. Run python create-seed-keydx.py to generate the list of key diagnoses to put into seeds.rb


The base files with the diagnoses in them are
keydiagnosis-list  for the key diagnoses
diagnosis-list.txt for categories 1, 2 and 3

Diagnoses can be edited as required as long as the formatting is kept and the seed code is generated again.
