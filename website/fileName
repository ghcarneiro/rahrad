NONCONTRAST ABDOMINAL PELVIS CT HAS BEEN PERFORMED DUE TO THE PATIENT'S ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  A SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION IS PRESENT AND THERE IS A MODERATE AMOUNT OF ASCITES.  ASSOCIATED RIGHT BASAL ATELECTASIS. INFLAMMATORY CHANGE CAN BE SEEN IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RETROPERITONEUM WITH THICKENING OF THE RIGHT ANTERIOR PERINEPHRIC FASCIA AND THE RIGHT LATERAL CONAL FASCIA EXTENDING DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF THE PELVIS.  BOTH KIDNEYS APPEAR NORMAL IN APPEARANCE AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF HYDRONEPHROSIS.  I NOTE THE PREVIOUS PANCREATITIS BUT THE PANCREATIC FAT PLAINS DO APPEAR PRESERVED ON THIS STUDY. NO ABNORMALITY IS SEEN OF THE SMALL OR LARGE BOWEL.  LIVER, SPLEEN AND ADRENAL ARE UNREMARKABLE.  COMMENT:  RIGHT SIDED EFFUSION, MODERATE AMOUNT OF ASCITES AND INFLAMMATORY CHANGE IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RETROPERITONEUM.  I AM UNSURE TO THE CAUSE OF THIS CHANGE IN THE RETROPERITONEUM BUT IF THERE HAS BEEN PREVIOUS BIOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE OF PANCREATITIS THIS MAY WELL BE THE CAUSE.
