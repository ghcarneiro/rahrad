CLINICAL:   ?MECHANICAL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.   CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: PORTAL VENOUS PHASE POST CONTRAST SCANS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED.  A FOLEY CATHETER IS DEMONSTRATED IN THE RECTUM WITH THE RETENTION BALLOON PARTIALLY INFLATED.  IT WOULD APPEAR THAT GASTROGRAFIN HAS BEEN INJECTED VIA THIS ROUTE.  THE GASTROGRAFIN ENTERS A DILATED SEGMENT OF SIGMOID COLON, ASSOCIATED WITH SPIRALLING OF VESSELS IN THE MESENTERY.  NO MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTIVE LESION IS IDENTIFIED AND FEATURES ARE CONSISTENT WITH A PARTIAL VOLVULUS.  THE MORE PROXIMAL SIGMOID COLON AND REMAINDER OF LARGE BOWEL ARE OF NORMAL CALIBRE.  THE SPLEEN CONTAINS A SMALL HYPOATTENUATING FOCUS CONSISTENT WITH A CYST.  A  SMALL LEFT LOBE OF LIVER IS NOTED AND THERE IS MILD BILIARY PROMINENCE BUT  NO LIVER MASS LESION IS IDENTIFIED.  THERE HAS BEEN A PREVIOUS  CHOLECYSTECTOMY.  SMALL CALCIFICATION CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATA ARE NOTED.   THE RIGHT ADRENAL GLAND CONTAINS A HYPOATTENUATING LESION CONSISTENT WITH AN  INCIDENTAL ADENOMA.  THERE IS SOME SCARRING AT THE INFERIOR POLE OF THE  RIGHT KIDNEY.  NO PARA-AORTIC OR PELVIC ADENOPATHY IDENTIFIED.    THERE IS A DIRECT RIGHT SIDED INGUINAL HERNIA WHICH INVOLVES THE WALL OF THE  BLADDER.  NO ASCITES.    NEW ATELECTASIS IS FOUND AT THE RIGHT LUNG BASE.  THE LEFT LUNG BASE IS  CLEAR.  NO PLEURAL EFFUSIONS.   CONCLUSION:   PR CONTRAST REACHES THE DILATED SEGMENT OF SIGMOID, CONFIRMING PATENCY.  NO  OBSTRUCTING MASS LESION IS SEEN AT THE POINT OF TRANSITION BETWEEN DILATED  SIGMOID AND THE MORE NORMAL CALIBRE RECTUM.  APPEARANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH  PARTIAL SIGMOID VOLVULUS. INCIDENTAL RIGHT DIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA INVOLVING  BLADDER WALL.    DR B LORRAINE 
Now I can see this volvulus. Hydrogen. Helium. Lithium Beryllium. Boron. Carbon. Nitrogen Oxygen. Fluorine. Neon.
