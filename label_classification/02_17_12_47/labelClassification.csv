THERE IS MILD DILATATION OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLES AS NOTED ON THE PREVIOUS CT SCAN OF 3/7/00. THE STUDY CONFIRMS THE PRESENCE OF A MASS LESION IN THE POSTERIOR FOSSA MEASURING 3.2CM IN DIAMETER AND CAUSING EFFACEMENT AND DISTORTION OF THE FOURTH VENTRICLE. THE LESION APPEARS TO BE CENTRED ON THE BRAIN STEM IE PONS AND EXTENDING INTO THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA. IT EXTENDS ON THE LEFT INTO THE LEFT CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE. THERE IS A RIM OF RESIDUAL BRAIN PARENCHYMA AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE LESION ANTERIORLY AND TO THE RIGHT. THE MASS EXTENDS UP TO THE LEVEL OF THE BASILIAR ARTERY ANTERIORLY. THERE IS NO DEFINITE EFFACEMENT OF THE BASILAR ARTERY BUT THE LESION CLOSELY ABUTS IT AND IT IS PROBABLY ADHERENT TO IT. THE SOLID COMPONENT OF THE TUMOUR IS SITUATED ANTERIORLY AND SHOWS MODERATE IRREGULAR ENHANCEMENT AFTER IV CONTRAST.

"83100     MRI F/INV TUMOUR BRAIN/MENINGES PLA MRI  MRI HEAD UNDER GENERAL ANAESTHESIA RAH:  CLINICAL HISTORY: HEADACHE AND VOMITING. GAIT DISTURBANCE.  AXIAL T2, CORONAL T2, AXIAL FLAIR, MP CORONAL AXIAL AND SAGITTAL SEQUENCES WERE PERFORMED PRE AND POST IV CONTRAST. THERE IS MILD DILATATION OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLES AS NOTED ON THE PREVIOUS CT SCAN OF 3/7/00. THE STUDY CONFIRMS THE PRESENCE OF A MASS LESION IN THE POSTERIOR FOSSA MEASURING 3.2CM IN DIAMETER AND CAUSING EFFACEMENT AND DISTORTION OF THE FOURTH VENTRICLE. THE LESION APPEARS TO BE CENTRED ON THE BRAIN STEM IE PONS AND EXTENDING INTO THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA. IT EXTENDS ON THE LEFT INTO THE LEFT CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE. THERE IS A RIM OF RESIDUAL BRAIN PARENCHYMA AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE LESION ANTERIORLY AND TO THE RIGHT. THE MASS EXTENDS UP TO THE LEVEL OF THE BASILIAR ARTERY ANTERIORLY. THERE IS NO DEFINITE EFFACEMENT OF THE BASILAR ARTERY BUT THE LESION CLOSELY ABUTS IT AND IT IS PROBABLY ADHERENT TO IT. THE SOLID COMPONENT OF THE TUMOUR IS SITUATED ANTERIORLY AND SHOWS MODERATE IRREGULAR ENHANCEMENT AFTER IV CONTRAST. THERE IS A CYSTIC COMPONENT OCCUPYING THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE MASS EXTENDING INTO THE LEFT CEREBELLAR HEMISPHERE WHICH IS INDENTED. INFERIORLY, THE ENHANCING LESION EXTENDS INTO MEDULLA AND INVOLVES THE UPPER CERVICAL CORD DOWN TO THE UPPER ORDER OF C1. VERTEBRAL ARTERIES ON EITHER SIDE ARE PLACED LATERALLY BY THE TUMOUR WITHOUT DEFINITE ENCASEMENT BUT TUMOUR LIES IN CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO BOTH VERTEBRAL ARTERIES AS THEY EXTEND TO JOIN THE BASILAR ARTERY. THE CORONAL VIEWS CONFIRM THE MARKED DISPLACEMENT OF THE FLOOR OF THE FOURTH VENTRICLE BY THE TUMOUR WHICH EXTENDS MORE THAN THE LEFT OF THE MID LINE BUT IS PRIMARILY SITUATED WITHIN THE PONS AND MEDULLA CONSISTENT WITH AN INTRINSIC BRAIN STEM MIXED CYSTIC AND SOLID GLIOMA. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY EVIDENCE OF SPREAD OF TUMOUR ELSEWHERE WITHIN THE BRAIN AND NO OTHER ENHANCING LESIONS ARE DETECTED. CEREBRAL ATROPHY IS WIDELY PATENT. THE TUMOUR OBVIOUSLY OBSTRUCTS THE OUTLETS OF THE FORAMEN OF MAGENDIE'S AND LUSCHKA WITH RESULTANT FOURTH VENTRICLE DILATATION AND DISTORTION. "

THERE IS MILD DILATATION OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLES AS NOTED ON THE PREVIOUS CT SCAN OF 3/7/00. THE STUDY CONFIRMS THE PRESENCE OF A MASS LESION IN THE POSTERIOR FOSSA MEASURING 3.2CM IN DIAMETER AND CAUSING EFFACEMENT AND DISTORTION OF THE FOURTH VENTRICLE. THE LESION APPEARS TO BE CENTRED ON THE BRAIN STEM IE PONS AND EXTENDING INTO THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA. IT EXTENDS ON THE LEFT INTO THE LEFT CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE. THERE IS A RIM OF RESIDUAL BRAIN PARENCHYMA AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE LESION ANTERIORLY AND TO THE RIGHT. THE MASS EXTENDS UP TO THE LEVEL OF THE BASILIAR ARTERY ANTERIORLY.

THERE IS MILD DILATATION OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLES AS NOTED ON THE PREVIOUS CT SCAN OF 3/7/00. THE STUDY CONFIRMS THE PRESENCE OF A MASS LESION IN THE POSTERIOR FOSSA MEASURING 3.2CM IN DIAMETER AND CAUSING EFFACEMENT AND DISTORTION OF THE FOURTH VENTRICLE. THE LESION APPEARS TO BE CENTRED ON THE BRAIN STEM IE PONS AND EXTENDING INTO THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA. IT EXTENDS ON THE LEFT INTO THE LEFT CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE. THERE IS A RIM OF RESIDUAL BRAIN PARENCHYMA AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE LESION ANTERIORLY AND TO THE RIGHT. THE MASS EXTENDS UP TO THE LEVEL OF THE BASILIAR ARTERY ANTERIORLY. THERE IS NO DEFINITE EFFACEMENT OF THE BASILAR ARTERY BUT THE LESION CLOSELY ABUTS IT AND IT IS PROBABLY ADHERENT TO IT. THE SOLID COMPONENT OF THE TUMOUR IS SITUATED ANTERIORLY AND SHOWS MODERATE IRREGULAR ENHANCEMENT AFTER IV CONTRAST. THERE IS A CYSTIC COMPONENT OCCUPYING THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE MASS EXTENDING INTO THE LEFT CEREBELLAR HEMISPHERE WHICH IS INDENTED. INFERIORLY, THE ENHANCING LESION EXTENDS INTO MEDULLA AND INVOLVES THE UPPER CERVICAL CORD DOWN TO THE UPPER ORDER OF C1. VERTEBRAL ARTERIES ON EITHER SIDE ARE PLACED LATERALLY BY THE TUMOUR WITHOUT DEFINITE ENCASEMENT BUT TUMOUR LIES IN CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO BOTH VERTEBRAL ARTERIES AS THEY EXTEND TO JOIN THE BASILAR ARTERY.

CONSOLIDATION IS STILL SEEN AT THE LEFT LUNG BASE, AND IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED FROM THE SCAN OF 5 DAYS PREVIOUSLY. THERE IS NO PLEURAL EFFUSION. THE RIGHT LUNG BASE IS CLEAR.  THE ADRENAL GLANDS ARE NORMAL. THERE ARE BILATERAL SMALL KIDNEYS, CONSISTENT WITH ENDSTAGE RENAL FAILURE. I BELIEVE THIS PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS RENAL TRANSPLANT; A CALCIFIED, NON ENHANCING MASS PRESENT IN THE LEFT ILIAC FOSSA AND COULD REPRESENT A NON FUNCTIONING TRANSPLANT KIDNEY. THE SPLEEN IS ENLARGED, SPANNING 17CM. THE UNENHANCED LIVER AND GALLBLADDER ARE OF NORMAL APPEARANCE. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF PARA AORTIC OR PELVIC LYMPHADENOPATHY. THE SOFT TISSUE MASS PREVIOUSLY NOTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SIGMOID COLON IS AGAIN SHOWN. THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN APPEARANCES. CHANGESCOULD REPRESENT DIVERTICULITIS/PHLEGMON, BUT SIGMOID CARCINOMA SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED. CONCLUSION: LEFT LOWER LOBE CONSOLIDATION. ENDSTAGE KIDNEYS. INFLAMMATORY MASS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGMOID COLON UNCHANGED FROM THE EXAMINATION OF 8/3/00. "

"8160      CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS - CONTRAST ONLY MREC  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: CLINICAL INFORMATION: PREVIOUS RADIOTHERAPY FOR RECTAL CANCER FOR FOLLOW UP 6 MONTHS.  TECHNIQUE: POST CONTRAST AXIAL SCANS FROM DOMES OF DIAPHRAGM TO PUBIC SYMPHYSIS. THREE PHASE LIVER STUDY HAS BEEN PERFORMED. COMPARISON HAS BEEN MADE WITH THE PREVIOUS FILMS OF 29/11/1999. LUNG BASES ARE CLEAR AND THERE ARE NO PLEURAL EFFUSIONS. THERE ARE THREE LESIONS SEEN WITHIN THE LIVER, A SMALL HYPODENSE LESION IN SEGMENT 8 OF THE LIVER, A SECOND SMALL HYPODENSE LESION IS SEEN IN SEGMENT 8 OF THE LIVER WHICH WAS NOT PRESENT ON THE PREVIOUS SCAN. THERE IS ALSO A SUBCAPSULAR MASS ON SEGMENT 4A OF THE LIVER WHICH IS ALSO NOT PRESENT ON THE PREVIOUS SCANS. THESE LESIONS ARE HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS OF METASTATIC DEPOSITS. THE SPLEEN, PANCREAS AND ADRENALS ARE UNREMARKABLE. BOTH KIDNEYS ENHANCE WELL AND ARE SEEN TO EXCRETRE CONTRAST. THE AORTA IS NOT DILATED THROUGHOUT ITS LENGTH. THERE IS NO ABDOMINAL OR PELVIC LYMPHADENOPATHY. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF LOCAL RECURRENCE.  COMMENT: THREE LESIONS IN SEGMENT 4A AND 8 OF THE LIVER WHICH ARE SUSPICIOUS OF METASTATIC DEPOSITS.

"8160      CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS - CONTRAST ONLY L3    CLINICAL DETAILS: THORACIC AORTIC DISSECTION. ?ASCENDING AORTIC INVOLVEMENT.  CT CHEST AND ABDOMEN:  5MM ARTERIAL PHASE AXIAL SLICES OF THE ENTIRE AORTA.  THERE IS MARKED ECTASIA AND ANEURYSMAL DILATATION OF THE THORACIC AORTA WITH MARKED MURAL THICKENING CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS DISSECTION.  AN ACTUAL FLAP HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED ON THIS STUDY.  THE ASCENDING AORTA IS OF NORMAL CALIBRE AND NO FLAP IS SEEN ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME INTERMAL THICKENING SUPERIORLY.  INFERIORLY THE AORTIC ROOT APPEARS UNREMARKABLE.  THE RIGHT HEMITHORAX IS FILLED WITH BLOOD AND THERE IS A LARGE EXTRA-PLEURAL HAEMATOMA IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CHEST WHICH IS EXTENDING DOWN AND CONTINUOUS WITH THE RETROCRURAL HAEMATOMA.  THE AORTA AT THE LEVEL OF THE DIAPHRAGMATIC CRURA IS NORMAL BUT INFRA-RENALLY THE ABDOMINAL AORTA MEASURES 7CM.  NO EVIDENCE OF LEAK FROM THE ABDOMINAL AORTA, THE ANEURYSM EXTENDS INTO BOTH COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES.  A PRECISE SITE OF LEAKING FROM THE THORACIC AORTA IS NOT IDENTIFIED BUT THERE IS A SMALL BEADED FOCI OF CONTRAST IN THE MID THORACIC AORTA WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE MOST LIKELY SITE. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO EXTRAVAZATION OF CONTRAST TO SUGGEST ACTIVE BLEEDING. INCIDENTAL NOTE OF GALLSTONES AND MULTIPLE RENAL CYSTS. "
