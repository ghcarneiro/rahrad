REPORT; HISTORY OF COLLAPSE AND RIGHT TEMPORAL LESION NOTED. THE LATERAL VENTRICLES ARE NORMAL IN SIZE SHOWING A MINOR DEGREE OF MIDLINE SHIFT TO THE LEFT.  THE SPACE OCCUPYING LESION NOTED ON THE CT SCAN IN THE RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE IS AGAIN NOTED. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT MASS EFFECT WITH ELEVATION OF THE RIGHT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY AND SYLVIAN FISSURE.  THERE IS EFFACEMENT OF THE OVERLYING GYRI.  THE LESION IS IN THE ANTERIOR RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE INVOLVING CORTEX AND ADJACENT WHITE MATTER AND APPEARS TO BE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE OVERLYING MENINGES.  ON T2 THE LESION IS OF MIXED SIGNAL SHOWING CENTRAL AREAS OF LOW SIGNAL WITH SURROUNDING HIGH SIGNAL THE LATTER INDICATING OEDEMA.  ON T1 THE LESION IS MAINLY INTERMEDIATE IN SIGNAL WITH A SMALL FEW HIGH SIGNAL AREAS SUGGESTING RECENT HAEMORRHAGE.  THERE ARE NO SIGNAL VOIDS ON THE T1 SEQUENCE TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF CALCIFICATION. PATCHY HIGH SIGNAL ON T1 BEST SEEN ON THE MP RAGE T1 CORONAL SEQUENCE PRE CONTRAST.  ON THE FLASH 2D SEQUENCE THERE IS EXTENSIVE LOW SIGNAL SHOWING AN IRREGULAR DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE LESION ABUTTING THE OVERLYING DURA CONSISTENT WITH HAEMORRHAGE.  THERE IS A SMALL LINEAR FLUID COLLECTION IN THE EXTRA AXIAL SPACES OVERLYING THE RIGHT FRONTAL LOBE AND EXTENDING INTO THE TEMPORAL LOBE AREA CONSISTENT WITH A PROBABLE ASSOCIATED HAEMORRHAGE IN THE SUB-DURAL SPACE ON THE RIGHT.  THERE IS MINOR EFFACEMENT OF THE RIGHT TEMPORAL HORN BY THE LESION.  NO OTHER DEFINITE LESIONS ARE SEEN.  THE RIGHT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY IS DISPLACED AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE LESION IE; SUPERIORLY AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ENLARGED.  NO DEFINITE ANEURYSM IS IDENTIFIED ON THE AVAILABLE IMAGES.  THERE APPEARS TO BE RATHER PROMINENT LINEAR SIGNAL VOID LYING INFERIORLY IN RELATION TO THE RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE ON THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE LESION POSSIBLY REPRESENTING A DRAINING VENOUS STRUCTURE.  SMALL BRANCHES OF THE RIGHT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY ALSO APPEAR TO ENTER THE LESION. MINOR MENINGEAL ENHANCEMENT OVER THE RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE POST CONTRAST NOTED.  THE OVERALL APPEARANCES SUGGEST MIXED ACUTE AND SUB-ACUTE HAEMORRHAGE IN THE RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE WITH EXPANSION AND ASSOCIATED SPACE OCCUPYING EFFECT. THERE IS A PROBABLE MIMINAL ASSOCIATED BLOOD COLLECTION OF THE RIGHT SUB-DURAL SPACE IN THE FRONTAL AREA.  THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS LIES BETWEEN HAEMORRHAGE INTO AN ARTERIAL VENOUS MALFORMATION AND LEADING INTO A TUMOUR. PRESENCES OF MARKED OEDEMA AROUND THE LESION FAVOURS AN UNDERLYING SPACE OCCUPYING LESION BUT THE CONTRAST SERIES DOES NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT WITHIN THE LESION WHICH WOULD ARGUE AGAINST THIS POSSIBILITY.  IS THERE ANY CLINICAL HISTORY OF EXPOSURE TO RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR UNDERLYING BLEEDING ...........  ?   AN UNDERLYING ARTERIAL VENOUS MALFORMATION WITH SUB-ACUTE HAEMORRHAGE WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE MOST LIKELY AETIOLOGY ALTHOUGH LARGE ASSOCIATED VASCULAR STRUCTURES HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED EXCEPT FOR POSSIBLE DRAINING VEIN AS DESCRIBED.
