TECHNIQUE:  TODAY'S STUDY HAS BEEN PERFORMED WITH FLAIR, PROTON DENSITY AND TWO T2  WEIGHTED AXIAL SLICES.  PRE AND POST CONTRAST CORONAL SEQUENCES HAVE BEEN  PERFORMED.     REPORT:  THE CORTICAL SWELLING IN THE RIGHT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE HAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY  CHANGED AS COMPARED WITH THE RECENT STUDY.  THE CORTEX APPEARS MILDLY  THICKER AND IS SLIGHTLY MORE INTENSE ON FLAIR SEQUENCES THAN PREVIOUS.

THERE IS SUBTLE CORTICAL ENHANCEMENT IN THE  RIGHT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE, ESPECIALLY SURROUNDING THE INSULAR TEMPORAL AND  PARIETAL LOBES.  A MORE CONFLUENT AREA OF ENHANCEMENT, OVAL IN SHAPE CAN BE  SEEN DEEP IN THE PARIETO-OCCIPITAL FISSURE.

8160      CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS - CONTRAST ONLY MREC  CT ABDOMEN  HISTORY: CLL  TO CDA TRIAL.   COMPARISON IS MADE WITH THE PREVIOUS STUDY PERFORMED ON 22/2/2000.    POST CONTRAST CT HAS BEEN PERFORMED AS WELL AS SPLENIC VOLUME.   THE SPLEEN IS MILDLY SMALLER IN SIZE COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS STUDY SPAN.  ON TODAY'S STUDY IT IS 12CM AND 13CM PREVIOUSLY.   THE SPLENIC VOLUME MEASURES 622.65CM CUBED. THE LIVER IS OF NORMAL SIZE.  THE PREVIOUSLY NOTED ADENOPATHY INVOLVING THE RETROPERITONEUM AND PROXIMAL MESENTERIC AXIS HAVE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY IN SIZE.   THE LARGEST NODE CAN BE SEEN IMMEDIATELY INFERIOR TO THE LEFT RENAL VEIN MEASURING 2.0CM IN SHORT AXIS DIAMETER.  THE PREVIOUS STUDY HAD MEASURED 2.5CM.   ALL NODES APPEAR REDUCED IN SIZE AND NUMBER.  THE ADENOPATHY EXTENDS DOWN TO THE INTERNAL ILIAC CHAIN.  THERE ARE ALSO SMALL INGUINAL NODES BUT THESE ARE ALL SMALLER THAN 8MM IN SHORT AXIS DIAMETER.  THE PREVIOUS LEFT HERNIA REPAIR IS NOTED.   BOTH KIDNEYS ARE OF NORMAL APPEARANCE.   PANCREAS AND BOWEL ARE UNREMARKABLE.  NO EVIDENCE OF FREE FLUID.   THE LUNG BASES ARE CLEAR EXCEPT FOR SOME BASAL ATELECTASIS.  COMMENT: SUBTOTAL RESOLUTION OF DISEASE.
