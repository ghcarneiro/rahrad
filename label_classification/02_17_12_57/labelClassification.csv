THE MASS EXTENDS POSTERIORLY EFFACING AND DISPLACING THE LATERAL VENTRICLES.     IN THE MIDLINE THE LESION APPEARS TO OBLITERATE THE THIRD VENTRICLE.  THE MIDBRAIN STRUCTURES ARE DISPLACED POSTERIORLY AND THE CORPUS CALLOSUM IS ELEVATED AND DISPLACED SUPERIORLY.  THERE ARE MULTIPLE SEPTATIONS WITHIN THE LESION WHICH IS PRIMARILY CYSTIC.  THE PITUITARY FOSSA APPEARS TO BE INTACT AND THE INFUNDIBULAR STALK IS VISUALISED.  THE MASS LIES ADJACENT TO THE OPTIC CHIASM WITHIN THE FRONTAL LOBE BUT IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE INVOLVED.  THE FOURTH VENTRICLE IS SMALL AND THE AQUEDUCT APPEARS TO BE OBSTRUCTED BY THE ADJACENT DISTORTION AND MASS EFFECT.  THE LATERAL VENTRICLES ARE MODERATELY DILATED AND EFFACED AS DESCRIBED.  THERE IS A SOLID COMPONENT WHICH IS IN THE MIDLINE AND INVOLVING THE DURA (IE FALX) SHOWING NODULAR CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT POST IV GADOLINIUM.  THE ANTERIOR CEREBRAL ARTERIES ARE DIFFICULT TO VISUALISE BUT APPEAR TO RUN IN THE MID LINE IN THE VICINITY OF THE AREA OF CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT.

ASSOCIATED HYDROCEPHALUS WITH LATERAL VENTRICULAR DILATATION AND AQUEDUCT OBSTRUCTION.  DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS INCLUDES INFANTILE DESMOPLASTIC GANGLOGLIOMA, CYSTIC ASTROCYTOMA AND PRIMITIVE NEUROECTODERMAL TUMOUR.  INFANTILE DESMOPLASTIC GANGLOGLIOMA IS FAVOURED IN VIEW OF THE LARGE CYSTIC COMPONENT OF THE MASS AND CENTRAL ENHANCING TUMOUR NODULE LYING IN RELATION TO THE DURA. "

AXIAL T2, CORONAL T2, AXIAL FLAIR, MP CORONAL AXIAL AND SAGITTAL SEQUENCES WERE PERFORMED PRE AND POST IV CONTRAST. THERE IS MILD DILATATION OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLES AS NOTED ON THE PREVIOUS CT SCAN OF 3/7/00. THE STUDY CONFIRMS THE PRESENCE OF A MASS LESION IN THE POSTERIOR FOSSA MEASURING 3.2CM IN DIAMETER AND CAUSING EFFACEMENT AND DISTORTION OF THE FOURTH VENTRICLE. THE LESION APPEARS TO BE CENTRED ON THE BRAIN STEM IE PONS AND EXTENDING INTO THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA. IT EXTENDS ON THE LEFT INTO THE LEFT CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE. THERE IS A RIM OF RESIDUAL BRAIN PARENCHYMA AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE LESION ANTERIORLY AND TO THE RIGHT. THE MASS EXTENDS UP TO THE LEVEL OF THE BASILIAR ARTERY ANTERIORLY. THERE IS NO DEFINITE EFFACEMENT OF THE BASILAR ARTERY BUT THE LESION CLOSELY ABUTS IT AND IT IS PROBABLY ADHERENT TO IT. THE SOLID COMPONENT OF THE TUMOUR IS SITUATED ANTERIORLY AND SHOWS MODERATE IRREGULAR ENHANCEMENT AFTER IV CONTRAST. THERE IS A CYSTIC COMPONENT OCCUPYING THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE MASS EXTENDING INTO THE LEFT CEREBELLAR HEMISPHERE WHICH IS INDENTED. INFERIORLY, THE ENHANCING LESION EXTENDS INTO MEDULLA AND INVOLVES THE UPPER CERVICAL CORD DOWN TO THE UPPER ORDER OF C1. VERTEBRAL ARTERIES ON EITHER SIDE ARE PLACED LATERALLY BY THE TUMOUR WITHOUT DEFINITE ENCASEMENT BUT TUMOUR LIES IN CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO BOTH VERTEBRAL ARTERIES AS THEY EXTEND TO JOIN THE BASILAR ARTERY. THE CORONAL VIEWS CONFIRM THE MARKED DISPLACEMENT OF THE FLOOR OF THE FOURTH VENTRICLE BY THE TUMOUR WHICH EXTENDS MORE THAN THE LEFT OF THE MID LINE BUT IS PRIMARILY SITUATED WITHIN THE PONS AND MEDULLA CONSISTENT WITH AN INTRINSIC BRAIN STEM MIXED CYSTIC AND SOLID GLIOMA. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY EVIDENCE OF SPREAD OF TUMOUR ELSEWHERE WITHIN THE BRAIN AND NO OTHER ENHANCING LESIONS ARE DETECTED. CEREBRAL ATROPHY IS WIDELY PATENT. THE TUMOUR OBVIOUSLY OBSTRUCTS THE OUTLETS OF THE FORAMEN OF MAGENDIE'S AND LUSCHKA WITH RESULTANT FOURTH VENTRICLE DILATATION AND DISTORTION. "

PROCEDURE: GIVEN THE PATIENT'S POOR RENAL FUNCTION INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST WAS NOT ADMINISTERED. 10MM SLICES WERE TAKEN FROM THE LUNG BASES THROUGH TO PUBIC SYMPHYSIS.

THE PATIENT FOUND THE INSTALLATION OF AIR QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE AND ALTHOUGH THERE APPEARED TO BE ADEQUATE COLONIC DISTENSION ON THE SCOUT VIEW WE HAD EXTREME DIFFICULTY IN PRODUCING A 3 DIMENSIONAL NAVIGATIONAL PICTURE OF THE COLON.

8155      CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS - PLAIN L3  3D CT VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY  A TUBE WAS INSERTED INTO THE PATIENTS RECTUM AND FOLLOWING IV ADMINISTRATION OF 20MGS OF BUSCOPAN THE COLON WAS INFLATED WITH AIR.  A SCOUT VIEW SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS ADEQUATE COLONIC DISTENSION IN BOTH PRONE AND SUPINE 3D SPIRAL ACQUISITIONS THROUGH THE ABDOMEN WERE TAKEN.  THE PATIENT FOUND THE INSTALLATION OF AIR QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE AND ALTHOUGH THERE APPEARED TO BE ADEQUATE COLONIC DISTENSION ON THE SCOUT VIEW WE HAD EXTREME DIFFICULTY IN PRODUCING A 3 DIMENSIONAL NAVIGATIONAL PICTURE OF THE COLON.  A REVIEW OF THE AXIAL IMAGES FROM THE PRONE AND SUPINE SERIES HOWEVER DOES NOT REVEAL ANY SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY WITHIN THE COLON DISTAL TO THE SIGMOID.  THE RECTUM WHICH ALSO HAS BEEN VISUALISED BY STANDARD ENDOSCOPY APPEARED NORMAL TO US. WITHIN THE SIGMOID REGION THERE WAS HOWEVER MARKED UNIFORM THICKENING OF THE WALL OF THE BOWEL.  THERE IS OBVIOUS ASSOCIATED DIVERTICULAR DISEASE AND SUPERIORLY THERE IS AN AREA OF FOCAL PERFORATION AND A PERIDIVERTICULAR ABSCESS IS PRESENT.  IT IS DIFFICULT BY CT TO ASSESS WHETHER THIS APPEARANCE OF THE COLON SIMPLY REPRESENTS A DIVERTICULAR PHLEGMON OR WHETHER THERE COULD BE SOME UNDERLYING NEOPLASIA.  THERE IS NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS.

REPORT: COMPARISON IS MADE WITH THE PREVIOUS PRIVATE SCANS FROM DR JONES OF 28/3/2000. A SURFACE MARKER WAS PLACED ON THE SKIN IN THE REGION OF THE KNOWN LUMP. IN THIS REGION THERE IS ABNORMAL SOFT TISSUE OF THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL INVOLVING THE LEFT ASPECT OF THE RECTUS SHEATH EXTENDING POSTERIORLY TO ABUT THE ANTERIOR WALL OF THE BODY OF THE STOMACH.
