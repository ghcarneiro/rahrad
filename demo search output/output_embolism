CTPA      CLINICAL:   SHORT OF BREATH. CHEST PAIN. HAEMOPTYSIS. ON CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER.  EXCLUDE PE.   FINDINGS:   IMAGE QUALITY WAS REDUCED AS VENOUS ACCESS WAS VIA THE FOOT AND THERE WAS  REDUCED OPACIFICATION OF THE PULMONARY ARTERIAL TREE.   STUDY HOWEVER WAS POSITIVE FOR PULMONARY EMBOLI WITH MULTIPLE EMBOLI SEEN  WITHIN RIGHT LOWER LOBE BRANCHES. NO OBVIOUS EMBOLI WAS SEEN ELSEWHERE BUT  THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL TINY PERIPHERAL EMBOLI UNABLE TO BE DETECTED ON  THIS STUDY DUE TO THE REDUCED DIAGNOSTIC QUALITY.   THERE WAS COLLAPSE/CONSOLIDATION LEFT LOWER LOBE AND SMALL TO MODERATE LEFT  PLEURAL EFFUSION. MILD ATELECTASIS RIGHT LOWER LOBE.   NO PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WAS SEEN.  THERE WAS NO MEDIASTINAL OR HILAR MASS.   CONCLUSION:   SCAN POSITIVE FOR PULMONARY EMBOLI SEEN WITHIN RIGHT LOWER LOBE BRANCHES.  EXAMINATION WAS OF REDUCED DIAGNOSTIC QUALITY. ADDITIONAL TINY PERIPHERAL   EMBOLI NOT EXCLUDED. REPORTED BY: DR J T SYKES

CTPA    CLINICAL DETAILS  IE AWAITING VALVE REPLACEMENT.  EMBOLI ON RECENT CT AND DETERIORATING RIGHT  HEART FUNCTION.  NEED TO EXCLUDE NON INFECTIVE PULMONARY EMBOLI.   REPORT   COMPARISON MADE WITH PREVIOUS CT FROM 11/12/12.  THERE IS SATISFACTORY OPACIFICATION OF THE PULMONARY ARTERIES. NO FILLING  DEFECT IS SEEN TO SUGGEST PRESENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM. GROUND GLASS OPACITY INVOLVING THE UPPER LOBES BILATERALLY SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS STUDY.  THERE ARE GROUND GLASS ATTENUATION SEEN OF THE RIGHT MIDDLE  AND LEFT LINGULAR.  CONSOLIDATION IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE WITH ASSOCIATED  MODERATE PLEURAL EFFUSION IS UNCHANGED.  MULTIPLE MEDIASTINAL LYMPHNODES  ARE AGAIN NOTED.  VISUALISED UPPER ABDOMEN APPEAR UNREMARKABLE. NEGATIVE STUDY FOR PULMONARY EMBOLISM.  MULTIFOCAL BILATERAL SEPTATE EMBOLI AND RIGHT LOWER LOBE CONSOLIDATION WITH ASSOCIATED PLEURAL EFFUSION IS STABLE IN APPEARANCE.     REPORTED BY DR. L. LEE/SM. REVIEWED BY DR. K. FUNAHASHI.

CT PA    CLINICAL DETAILS:   PREVIOUS SUBSTANTIAL PULMONARY EMBOLISM IN 2009.  CURRENTLY EIGHT WEEKS  PREGNANT ON PROPHYLAXIS.  INTERMITTENT BREATHLESSNESS ? EVIDENCE OF  RECURRENT PE.   REPORT:   ARTEFACT SECONDARY TO THE PATIENT BODY HABITUS LIMITS ASSESSMENT.  THERE IS  NO EVIDENCE OF FILLING DEFECTS CENTRALLY TO SUGGEST CENTRAL PULMONARY  EMBOLISM. ASSESSMENT FOR PERIPHERAL EMBOLI IS DIFFICULT ON THIS STUDY.  THE LUNGS ARE CLEAR OF AIRSPACE OPACITY.  THERE IS NO PLEURAL EFFUSION.  REPORTED BY DR S MCKEEN.
