CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS    CLINICAL DETAILS:   RIGHT URETERIC CALCULUS - URETERIC STENT.  FOLLOW-UP.   PROCEDURE:   UNENHANCED URETERIC CALCULUS PROTOCOL.   FINDINGS:   A RIGHT SIDED STENT DEMONSTRATED WITH THE PROXIMAL END IN THE PELVIS AND  DISTAL END WELL WITHIN THE BLADDER.  NO CALCULUS IN THE RENAL PELVIS, URETER  OR BLADDER.  THERE IS AN OVOID CALCULUS IN THE LOWER POLE OF THE RIGHT  KIDNEY MEASURING 10 X 5MM.  PERIURETERIC STRANDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE  PROXIMAL TO MID URETER ON THE RIGHT.  CALCIFIED SPLENIC AND BILATERAL ADRENAL GRANULOMAS NOTED.  VISUALISED LIVER NORMAL. PANCREAS NORMAL.  GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT NORMAL.  NO LYMPHADENOPATHY.  NO ASCITES.   CONCLUSION:     RIGHT LOWER POLE RENAL CALCULUS. NO URETERIC CALCULUS PRESENT. PREVIOUS CT NOT AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW.

HELICAL CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS    CLINICAL HISTORY:  LEFT URETERIC CALCULUS RADIO-LUCENT. CURRENT STATUS OF THE CALCULUS.   REPORT:  AT THE LEVEL OF THE KIDNEY, THERE IS MILD DILATATION OF THE LEFT COLLECTING  SYSTEM AND URETER.  OVOID CALCULUS IS PRESENT IN THE PELVIC LEFT URETER AT  THE LEVEL OF THE EXTERNAL ILIAC VESSELS.  DISTALLY THE LEFT URETER IS  NORMAL. ON THE RIGHT, MULTIPLE SMALL FLECKS OF CALCIFICATION PRESENT IN THE  REGION OF THE HILAR, WHICH ON REFLECTION ARE PROBABLY VASCULAR RATHER THAN IN  CALYCES. THE RIGHT URETER IS OTHERWISE NORMAL, AND NO PATHOLOGY IS PRESENT   IN THE OTHER ORGANS OF THE PELVIS.     CONCLUSION:  LEFT PELVIC URETERIC CALCULUS, CAUSING MILD TO MODERATE HYDRONEPHROSIS.

CT UROGRAM:    CLINICAL DETAILS:   HISTORY OF STAGHORN CALCULUS DIAGNOSIS JANUARY 2015.  NOW LEFT FLANK PAIN.   STONE IN URETER.   REPORT:   NO PRIOR STUDIES AVAILABLE FOR COMPARISON AT THE TIME OF REPORTING.  LEFT STAGHORN CALCULUS INVOLVING THE INFERIORLY POLE IS NOTED.  THERE HAS  BEEN A DISPLACED URETERIC CALCULUS MEASURING 20MM (748 HU) INTO THE PROXIMAL  LEFT URETER WITH ASSOCIATED MODERATE DILATATION OF THE PROXIMAL COLLECTING SYSTEM TO THIS.  NO DISTAL LEFT URETERIC CALCULUS EVIDENT.  NO BLADDER CALCULI SEEN.  THERE IS A SMALL CALCULUS IN THE INTERPOLAR REGION OF THE RIGHT KIDNEY ANTERIORLY MEASURING 2MM (343 HU).  NO OTHER RIGHT RENAL CALCULUS OR URETERIC CALCULUS SEEN.  THE RIGHT COLLECTING SYSTEM IS UNREMARKABLE.  THE OTHER MAJOR INTRA-ABDOMINAL ORGANS APPEAR LARGELY UNREMARKABLE WITHIN  CONSTRAINTS OF A NON CONTRAST STUDY.  NO FREE FLUID, FREE GAS OR INCIDENTAL  LYMPHADENOPATHY SEEN.  NO DESTRUCTIVE BONY LESION SEEN.   CONCLUSION:   DISPLACED LEFT INFERIOR POLE STAGHORN CALCULUS WITH THE CALCULUS MEASURING  20MM AND LOCATED IN THE PROXIMAL LEFT URETER WITH ASSOCIATED PROXIMAL  COLLECTING SYSTEM DILATATION.  UNCOMPLICATED RIGHT INTERPOLAR REGION RENAL  CALCULUS.  REPORTED BY DR. L. YAPP (JB).

CT UROGRAM     CLINICAL   LEFT FLANK PAIN. PREVIOUS RENAL STONES. FINDINGS   PAUCITY OF INTRA-ABDOMINAL FAT AND MULTIPLE PELVIC PHLEBOLITHS MAKE  ASSESSMENT FOR A DISTAL URETERIC CALCULUS DIFFICULT.  THERE IS A 5 MM CALCIFIC DENSITY CLOSE TO THE VUJ ON THE LEFT SIDE.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO BE CERTAIN WHETHER THIS LIES IN THE VERY DISTAL LEFT URETER OR REPRESENTS A PELVIC PHLEBOLITH JUST BELOW THE URETER.  HOWEVER JUDGING BY THE SYMMETRICAL  CALIBRE OF THE URETERS, LACK OF LEFT HYDRONEPHROSIS OR LEFT PERINEPHRIC  STRANDING, THIS IS FELT MORE LIKELY TO REPRESENT A PHLEBOLITH RATHER THAN AN  URETERIC CALCULUS.  THERE IS NO RENAL CALCULUS.  NO OTHER CALCULI IN THE   PATH OF THE URETERS.  NO BLADDER CALCULUS.    THE GALLBLADDER IS SURGICALLY ABSENT. A TINY CALCIFIC NODULE IN SEGMENT 2 OF THE LIVER IS LIKELY AN INCIDENTAL GRANULOMA.  THE OTHER ABDOMINAL ORGANS ARE  UNREMARKABLE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A NONCONTRAST CT.  THERE IS NO PATHOLOGICAL ABDOMINAL ADENOPATHY AND NO FREE FLUID IN THE ABDOMEN OR PELVIS.  THE LUNG BASES ARE CLEAR.  NO DESTRUCTIVE BONE LESIONS ARE IDENTIFIED.    COMMENT   NO CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF RENAL, URETERIC OR BLADDER CALCULUS. A SMALL  CALCIFIC BODY CLOSE TO THE LEFT VUJ IS FELT MORE LIKELY TO REPRESENT A  PELVIC PHLEBOLITH RATHER THAN A DISTAL URETERIC CALCULUS.     REPORTED BY DR.S.HATAMI

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS    CLINICAL INFORMATION:   LEFT FLANK PAIN. PROCEDURE:   UNENHANCED URETERIC CALCULUS PROTOCOL.   FINDINGS:   A 1-2MM CALCULUS IS PRESENT WITHIN THE DISTAL URETER JUST PROXIMAL TO THE  VUJ ON THE LEFT. NO HYDROURETER BUT THERE IS MILD HYDRONEPHROSIS. NO  PERINEPHRIC SOFT TISSUE STRANDING OR URINOMA. NO RENAL CALCULUS.  THE LIVER, SPLEEN, ADRENALS, PANCREAS AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT ARE  NORMAL.  NO LYMPHADENOPATHY OR ASCITES.   CONCLUSION:   DISTAL LEFT URETERIC CALCULUS.
