CT HEAD    CLINICAL HISTORY:   MULTITRAUMA PATIENT WITH MINOR TBI FOR MONITORING INTRACRANIAL HAEMORRHAGE  BEFORE COMMENCING ANTICOAGULATION. FINDINGS:   NON CONTRAST IMAGING WAS PERFORMED.  THERE IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE SUPERIORLY OVER EACH  VERTEX.  THERE WAS ALSO A TINY FOCUS OF HAEMORRHAGE AT ANTERIOR MARGIN OF  THE RIGHT SYLVIAN FISSURE. NO HAEMORRHAGE WAS SEEN ELSEWHERE.   APPEARANCES WERE SIMILAR TO 21/3/14 IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION OF THE  HAEMORRHAGE WITH SOME DECREASE IN DENSITY IN THE INTERIM IN KEEPING WITH   MATURATION.    NO OBVIOUS NEW HAEMORRHAGE WAS VISIBLE.    THE VENTRICULAR SYSTEM WAS NORMAL.  NO EXTRACEREBRAL FLUID COLLECTION WAS VISIBLE.  REPORTED BY DR J T SYKES.

CT HEAD CLINICAL DETAILS:  HEAD AND NECK PAIN FOR TWO TO THREE WEEKS. SUDDEN  COLLAPSE.  REPORT:  THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF HAEMORRHAGE WITHIN THE LEFT CEREBELLAR  HEMISPHERE ... AND THE SECOND AREA HAEMORRHAGE INTRAPARENCHYMAL WITHIN THE  UPPER LEFT MID BRAIN AND THALAMUS.  THERE IS ALSO INTRAVENTRICULAR  HAEMORRHAGE WITH DILATATION OF THE VENTRICULAR SYSTEM THOUGHT TO BE RELATED  TO MASS EFFECT WITHIN THE POSTERIOR FOSSA CONSISTENT WITH OBSTRUCTIVE  HYDROCEPHALUS.  THE SULCI ARE EFFACED IN KEEPING WITH CEREBRAL OEDEMA.   THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE.  NO EXTRA-AXIAL  HAEMORRHAGE IS DEMONSTRATED. INTERPRETATION:  PRIMARY CEREBELLAR AND THALAMIC HAEMORRHAGE.  FINDINGS MOST  RELATE TO UNDERLYING HYPERTENSIVE HAEMORRHAGE.  RESULTANT OBSTRUCTIVE HYDROCEPHALUS.

CT BRAIN    CLINICAL DETAILS:   BIFRONTAL HAEMORRHAGE SECONDARY TO FALL. GCS DROPPED YESTERDAY.   NEUROSURGERY MAY CONSIDER BURR HOLES.  ? ANY CHANGE WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR  GCS 10-11.   REPORT:   BIFRONTAL CONTUSIONAL HAEMORRHAGES WITH SURROUNDING OEDEMA WHICH APPEARS  GROSSLY STABLE IN COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS STUDY.  THERE IS FURTHE EVOLUTION  OF HAEMORRHAGES, WHICH APPEAR MORE HYPODENSE CURRENTLY.    EXTRA-AXIAL HAEMORRHAGE IN THE RIGHT PARIETAL REGION IS ALSO MARGINALLY  SMALLER AND APPEARS MORE HYPODENSE.  NO SUGGESTION OF FURTHER HAEMORRHAGE.   SCATTERED AREAS OF SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE TRAUMATIC IN NATURE, ARE NOTED  WITHIN THE RIGHT PARIETO-OCCIPITAL REGION, AS WELL AS THE LEFT PARIETAL  LOBE. MINIMAL SUBDURAL HAEMORRHAGE IS ALSO NOTED LAYERING IN THE LEFT  TENTORIUM. THIS IS UNCHANGED.  NO NEW AREAS OF HAEMORRHAGE.  VENTRICULAR CALIBRE IS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.   BILATERAL LOW DENSITY SUBDURAL COLLECTIONS ARE IN KEEPING WITH SUBDURAL  HYGROMAS.  APPEARANCES ARE UNCHANGED.  UNDISPLACED FRACTURE OF THE RIGHT  PARIETAL BONE AGAIN NOTED.   CONCLUSION:   NO EVIDENCE OF RE-HAEMORRHAGE.  MULTIPLE AREAS OF INTRA AND EXTRA-AXIAL TRAUMATIC HAEMORRHAGES ARE STABLE.  REPORTED BY DR K YANG/DR J BUCKLEY.

CT HEAD;  CLINICAL; PREVIOUS TRAUMATIC SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE. ANTICOAGULATED.  ASSESS FOR INTRA CRANIAL HAEMORRHAGE.     TECHNIQUE; PLAIN HELICAL SCANS.  REPORT; PROMINENCE OF VENTRICULAR SYSTEM AND CORTICAL SULCI IS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS  FOR PATIENTS AGE.  THERE IS NO INTRA CEREBRAL OR SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE.   THE LEFT SIDED SYLVIAN FISSURE HAEMORRHAGE AND PARIETAL GYRAL HAEMORRHAGE  SEEN ON THE PREVIOUS SCAN HAS RESOLVED.

CT HEAD:    CLINICAL HISTORY:   UNCONSCIOUS IN NURSING HOME.  EXCLUDE HAEMORRHAGE.   FINDINGS:   SCANS PERFORMED WITHOUT CONTRAST.    THERE WAS A LARGE HAEMORRHAGE IN THE UPPER BRAIN STEM EXTENDING TOWARDS  CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLES MORE ON THE RIGHT.  THE REGION OF HAEMORRHAGE WAS  APPROXIMATELY 4CM IN DIAMETER EXTENDING INTO THE MID BRAIN MORE ON THE  RIGHT.  THERE IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF HAEMORRHAGE WITHIN LEFT LATERAL VENTRICLE  IN THE DEPENDENT PORTION.  THERE WAS  DILATATION OF 3RD VENTRICLE  AND LATERAL VENTRICLES PRESUMABLY ON ACCOUNT OF DEGREE OF OBSTRUCTION IN THE  AQUEDUCT REGION.  THE BRAIN STEM HAEMORRHAGE ALSO WOULD BE PRODUCING SOME COMPRESSIVE EFFECT ON THE 4TH VENTRICLE.  THERE ARE POSSIBLY A FEW SMALL FOCI OF SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE OVER EACH CONVEXITY OR ELSE HAEMORRHAGE FOCI COULD BE PETECHIAL IN GYRI.  NO EXTRACEREBRAL HAEMORRHAGE COLLECTION WAS VISIBLE.  VENTRICULAR SYSTEM WAS ESSENTIALLY MIDLINE.  THERE WERE BACKGROUND ATROPHIC CHANGES IN THE BRAIN AND CHRONIC ISCHAEMIC WHITE MATTER CHANGES.   REPORTED BY DR. J. SYKES.
