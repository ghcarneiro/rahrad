CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  CLINICAL:   RECURRENT DIVERTICULITIS.    FINDINGS: NO PREVIOUS IMAGING IS AVAILABLE FOR COMPARISON.    THE DESCENDING COLON DEMONSTRATES THICKENING OF THE WALLS.  THERE ARE  DIVERTICULAE AND INFLAMMATORY CHANGES SECONDARY TO PARACOLIC GUTTER.  THERE  IS NO COLLECTION OR DEFINABLE FREE GAS AND THE FINDINGS WOULD BE CONSISTENT  WITH THE PRESENCE OF DIVERTICULITIS.  THERE IS DIVERTICULAR DISEASE IN THE SIGMOID COLON WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT ADJACENT INFLAMMATORY CHANGE.  THE LIVER, SPLEEN AND PANCREAS ARE UNREMARKABLE.  THE ADRENALS ARE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.  THERE ARE MULTIPLE BILATERAL RENAL CYSTS.  SOME OF THESE ARE PARAPELVIC IN NATURE.    THERE IS NO FREE FLUID IN THE ABDOMEN OR PELVIS. PROMINENT DEGENERATIVE DISEASE IS SEEN IN THE LUMBOSACRAL SPINE.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS, NON CONTRAST: THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SIGMOID DIVERTICULAR DISEASE, WITH LIKELY LONGSTANDING THICKENING OF THE SIGMOID COLONIC WALL.  ON TODAY'S STUDY THERE  IS ALSO SOME MILD PARACOLIC FAT STRANDING IN THIS REGION, INDICATIVE OF  LIKELY ACUTE DIVERTICULITIS.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF AN INTRAPERITONEAL OR  PELVIC COLLECTION/ABSCESS WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF A CT STUDY.    THE LIVER, SPLEEN, PANCREAS, ADRENALS, KIDNEYS, AND STOMACH APPEAR WITHIN  NORMAL LIMITS.  THERE IS NO MESENTERIC OR RETROPERITONEAL LYMPHADENOPATHY.   MILD ATHEROSCLEROTIC CALCIFICATION OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA IS NOTED.  THERE  IS MINIMAL BIBASAL DEPENDENT ATELECTASIS.  NO ACUTE FOCAL BONY ABNORMALITY  IS SEEN.   CONCLUSION:   SEVERE SIGMOID DIVERTICULAR DISEASE WITH EVIDENCE OF MILD ACUTE  UNCOMPLICATED DIVERTICULITIS, ON A BACKGROUND OF SIGNIFICANT SIGMOID COLONIC  WALL THICKENING REFLECTIVE OF MULTIPLE PAST EPISODES OF DIVERTICULITIS.
