CT UROGRAM:    CLINICAL DETAILS:   HISTORY OF STAGHORN CALCULUS DIAGNOSIS JANUARY 2015.  NOW LEFT FLANK PAIN.   STONE IN URETER.   REPORT:   NO PRIOR STUDIES AVAILABLE FOR COMPARISON AT THE TIME OF REPORTING.  LEFT STAGHORN CALCULUS INVOLVING THE INFERIORLY POLE IS NOTED.  THERE HAS  BEEN A DISPLACED URETERIC CALCULUS MEASURING 20MM (748 HU) INTO THE PROXIMAL  LEFT URETER WITH ASSOCIATED MODERATE DILATATION OF THE PROXIMAL COLLECTING SYSTEM TO THIS.  NO DISTAL LEFT URETERIC CALCULUS EVIDENT.  NO BLADDER CALCULI SEEN.  THERE IS A SMALL CALCULUS IN THE INTERPOLAR REGION OF THE RIGHT KIDNEY ANTERIORLY MEASURING 2MM (343 HU).  NO OTHER RIGHT RENAL CALCULUS OR URETERIC CALCULUS SEEN.  THE RIGHT COLLECTING SYSTEM IS UNREMARKABLE.  THE OTHER MAJOR INTRA-ABDOMINAL ORGANS APPEAR LARGELY UNREMARKABLE WITHIN  CONSTRAINTS OF A NON CONTRAST STUDY.  NO FREE FLUID, FREE GAS OR INCIDENTAL  LYMPHADENOPATHY SEEN.  NO DESTRUCTIVE BONY LESION SEEN.   CONCLUSION:   DISPLACED LEFT INFERIOR POLE STAGHORN CALCULUS WITH THE CALCULUS MEASURING  20MM AND LOCATED IN THE PROXIMAL LEFT URETER WITH ASSOCIATED PROXIMAL  COLLECTING SYSTEM DILATATION.  UNCOMPLICATED RIGHT INTERPOLAR REGION RENAL  CALCULUS.  REPORTED BY DR. L. YAPP (JB).

CT UROGRAM    CLINICAL HISTORY:  BACK PAIN.  ? STAGHORN CALCULUS LEFT SIDE. TECHNIQUE:  STANDARD CT UROGRAM PROTOCOL (NON CONTRAST) WAS PERFORMED. REPORT:   WHILST THE RATHER CONVINCING APPEARANCES OF A STAGHORN CALCULUS IN THE LEFT  UPPER QUADRANT ON PLAIN FILMS IS NOTED, THIS IN FACT DOES REPRESENT PATCHY  SPLENIC ARTERY CALCIFICATION, AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A STAGHORN  CALCULUS ON EITHER SIDE.  THERE IS A VERY SMALL MIDPOLE RENAL CALCULUS IN  THIS KIDNEY, AND A NUMBER OF SMALL AREAS OF MEDULLARY CALCIFICATION  BILATERALLY, ALONG WITH SEVERAL BENIGN SIMPLE CYSTS.  THERE IS BORDERLINE  DILATATION OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA, TO A MAXIMUM OF 3CM IN THE MID ABDOMEN,  ASSOCIATED WITH ATHEROMATOUS CALCIFICATION OF ITS WALL. THERE APPEARS TO BE  ACCESSORY FISSURE WITH RESPECT WITH THE LATERAL ASPECT OF THE RIGHT  HEMI-LIVER, WHICH IS FELT MOST LIKELY AN ANATOMICAL VARIANT. THE REMAINING  NON ENHANCED UPPER ABDOMINAL ORGANS WERE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS. DEGENERATIVE  CHANGES WERE NOTED AT DISC LEVEL IN THE LUMBAR SPINE, BUT NO DESTRUCTIVE  BONE LESION WAS IDENTIFIED.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF RENAL TRACT DILATATION  OR BLADDER CALCULUS.

CLINICAL INFORMATION  RIGHT STAGHORN CALCULUS RECURRENT PSEUDOMOSIS INFECTIONS.  REPORT:  NON CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN.  COMPARISON IS MADE WITH THE FILM FROM THE 26  NOVEMBER 2003.  THE EXTENSIVE DEFORMITIES DUE TO SPINA BIFIDA ARE AGAIN NOTED.  THE LARGE  RIGHT SIDED STAGHORN CALCULUS IS AGAIN IDENTIFIED.  THREE SEPARATE LARGE  AREAS OF CALCIFICATION ARE SEEN, THE LARGEST LOCATED WITHIN THE PELVIS.   FEATURES ARE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED. NO EVIDENCE OF OBSTRUCTION.  THERE IS  AGAIN EXTENSIVE CALCIFICATION WITHIN THE PROSTATE.  COMMENT:  RIGHT SIDED STAGHORN CALCULUS IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED IN  COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS FILM.  REVIEWED WITH DR G RUSH.

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS    CLINICAL   LEFT PUJ CALCULUS EXTRACTED 21ST SEPTEMBER 2007.   TECHNIQUE   PLAIN HELICAL SCANS    FINDINGS   THERE IS A 1-2 MM CALCULUS AT THE LOWER POLE OF THE RIGHT KIDNEY WHICH IS  SLIGHTLY ROTATED.  NO DILATATION OF THE COLLECTING SYSTEM OR URETERIC  CALCULUS. THERE IS A 3 MM CALCULUS AT THE LOWER POLE OF THE LEFT KIDNEY WITH A FURTHER  1 MM CALCULUS SLIGHTLY SUPERIORLY.  NO DILATATION OF THE COLLECTION SYSTEM  OR EVIDENCE OF URETERIC CALCULUS.  NO OTHER ABNORMALITY. COMMENT   SMALL RENAL CALCULI AS DESCRIBED.  NO OTHER ABNORMALITY DETECTED. REPORTED BY DR.R.HOILE.

CT SCAN OF ABDOMEN    CLINICAL HISTORY:   LEFT FLANK PAIN ? LEFT RENAL CALCULUS.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY TYPE 2  DIABETES.   REPORT:   HEART ENLARGED.  EXTREMELY LARGE LEFT RENAL PELVIS CALCULUS (STAGHORN CALCULUS). DIAMETER  2.6CM.  NO RIGHT RENAL CALCULUS SEEN.  THE LEFT KIDNEY APPEARS SWOLLEN WITH SOME PERINEPHRIC STRANDING. ?INFECTION  OR RECENT OBSTRUCTION. RIGHT KIDNEY OF NORMAL SIZE.  THE LEFT URETER IS A LITTLE PROMINENT BUT NO URETERIC CALCULUS IS  IDENTIFIED.  THE RIGHT URETER APPEARS NORMAL. BLADDER CLEAR WITH NO BLADDER CALCULUS SEEN.  LIVER AND SPLEEN APPEAR NORMAL.  PANCREAS INTACT.  GALLBLADDER NOT SEEN ?  CHOLECYSTECTOMY.  NO FOCAL BOWEL LESION SEEN.  ATHEROMATOUS AORTIC AND ILIAC CALCIFICATION, NO ANEURYSM.  NO  LYMPHADENOPATHY SEEN.
