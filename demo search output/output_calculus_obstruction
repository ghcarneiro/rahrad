CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS   THE OBSTRUCTING 5 MM CALCULUS AT THE LEVEL OF THE PELVIC RIM HAS MOVED  SLIGHTLY DISTALLY.  THERE IS A TINY MID URETERIC CALCULUS ON THE LEFT SIDE  WHICH IS NOT OBSTRUCTING AT THIS STAGE. REPORTED BY DR.F.DHARSONO

CLINICAL:   RIGHT RENAL COLIC.   CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:   NON CONTRAST CT KUB.  NIL COMPARISON.  THERE IS A 5CM CALCULUS AT THE RIGHT VUJ.  THERE IS ASSOCIATED HYDROURETER  BUT NO SIGNIFICANT HYDRONEPHROSIS.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT STRANDING.    THERE IS A SIMILAR 5MM CALCULUS AT THE RIGHT KIDNEY LOWER POLE.  A SMALLER  4MM CALCULUS IS SEEN IN THE LEFT, IN THE INTERPOLAR REGION AND JUST SUPERIOR  TO THIS A 3.5MM CALCULUS IS ALSO APPRECIATED.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF  URETERIC LEFT SIDED CALCULUS. FINDINGS COMPATIBLE WITH OBSTRUCTING VUJ CALCULUS ON THE RIGHT.   ALLOWING FOR THE LACK OF IV CONTRAST THE REMAINDER OF THE ABDOMINAL ORGANS  ARE UNREMARKABLE.  INCIDENTAL NOTE IS MADE OF A SMALL RIGHT SIDED BOCHDALEK HERNIA.  LUNG BASES ARE WELL AERATED AND THERE ARE NO DESTRUCTIVE BONY LESIONS.   COMMENT:   5MM OBSTRUCTING RIGHT VUJ CALCULUS.  HYDROURETER ASSOCIATED.    SEVERAL BILATERAL RENAL CALCULI WHICH AREN'T OBSTRUCTING. REPORTED BY DR L OAKDEN RAYNER (MHT) REVIEWED BY DR N RICE

CT UROGRAM:    CLINICAL HISTORY:   KNOWN LEFT STAGHORN CALCULUS NOW UTI ? OBSTRUCTION.    REPORT:   NON CONTRAST AXIAL SCANS WERE PERFORMED FROM THE DIAPHRAGM TO THE SYMPHYSIS.   THERE IS A LARGE STAGHORN CALCULUS LYING IN THE LEFT RENAL PELVIS AND  EXTENDING INTO THE UPPER POLE CALYCES. THIS IS NOT CAUSING ANY OBSTRUCTION.  THE CALCULUS HAS NOT ALTERED IN SIZE SINCE THE PREVIOUS EXAMINATION OF  29/11/05.  THE RIGHT KIDNEY IS OBSTRUCTED WITH A CALCULUS IN THE PELVIC PORTION OF THE  RIGHT URETER APPROXIMATELY 2CM ABOVE THE VESICOURETERIC JUNCTION. THIS IS  CAUSING SIGNIFICANT OBSTRUCTION WITH DISTENTION OF THE RENAL PELVIS AND  URETER. THERE IS ALSO NOTED TO BE SEVERAL BUBBLES OF GAS WITHIN THE RIGHT  RENAL PELVIS AND APPEARANCES SUGGEST A PYONEPHROSIS ASSOCIATED WITH A GAS  FORMING ORGANISM SECONDARY TO THE URETERIC OBSTRUCTION. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT  STRANDING IN THE SOFT TISSUES AROUND THE RIGHT KIDNEY IN THE PERINEPHRIC  SPACE ASSOCIATED WITH THE INFLAMMATION. THERE IS NOTED TO BE A SMALL  CALCULUS IN THE RIGHT RENAL PELVIS.   SMALL BILATERAL ADRENAL ADENOMAS ARE NOTED UNCHANGED SINCE THE PREVIOUS  SCAN.   CALCIFICATIONS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE PROSTATE.

RENAL CALCULUS PROTOCOL    CLINICAL HISTORY:  SECOND PRESENTATION OF RIGHT URETERIC COLIC.    TECHNIQUE:  A RENAL CALCULUS PROTOCOL WAS PERFORMED. REPORT:  THE RIGHT KIDNEY IS SLIGHTLY SWOLLEN, IS SLIGHTLY MORE HYPODENSE THAN THE  LEFT, AND THE COLLECTING SYSTEM IS SLIGHTLY PROMINENT.  THE URETER IS ALSO  SLIGHTLY PROMINENT IN ITS COURSE, AND A 2MM FOCAL HYPODENSITY IS SEEN IN THE  REGION OF THE RIGHT VUJ, WHICH WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH A PARTIALLY  OBSTRUCTING URETERIC CALCULUS.  THE LEFT KIDNEY AND COLLECTING SYSTEM ARE NORMAL, AS IS THE URETER. NO  OBVIOUS BLADDER ABNORMALITY IDENTIFIED.  NO OTHER FOCAL ABNORMALITY  DEMONSTRATED. COMMENT:  SMALL RIGHT VUJ CALCULUS, WITH PROXIMAL MILD OBSTRUCTION. PRESUMABLY A  PREVIOUS, LARGER CALCULUS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OBSTRUCTION.

HELICAL CT ABDOMEN:  CLINICAL DETAILS:  FILLING DEFECT ON IVP. ? RADIOLUCENT CALCULUS.  REPORT:    UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT HAVE THE IVP FOR COMPARISON AT THE TIME OF REPORTING  AND THERE HAS BEEN NO LOCALISATION AS TO THE SITE OF THE ABNORMALITY ON THE  IVP!  ON THE CURRENT STUDY THERE ARE SMALL FLECKS OF CALCIUM IN THE RENAL HILUM OF  THE RIGHT KIDNEY.  THE MOST SUPERIOR FLECK OF CALCIUM PROBABLY LIES IN A  CALYX HOWEVER THE MORE INFERIOR COMPONENT I SUSPECT IS VASCULAR.    HOWEVER THE MAIN PATHOLOGY LIES IN THE LEFT URETER WHERE THERE IS A SLIGHTLY  LARGER THAN 1CM CALCULUS IN THE PROXIMAL THIRD OF THE URETER RESULTING IN  MILD OBSTRUCTION PROXIMALLY.  THE CALCULUS LIES AT THE TRANSVERSE PROCESS OF  L1.  THE DISTAL LEFT URETER IS UN-OBSTRUCTED AND OF NORMAL CALIBRE.  NO  OTHER CALCULUS IDENTIFIED.    CONCLUSION: LEFT PROXIMAL URETERIC CALCULUS CAUSING PARTIAL OBSTRUCTION.  THE RIGHT  RENAL AREAS OF CALCIFICATION AS DESCRIBED.
