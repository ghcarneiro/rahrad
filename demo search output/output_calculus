CT ABDOMEN:    CLINICAL:   FOLLOW UP TO RIGHT LITHOTRIPSY AND STENT INSERTION BILATERALLY.   PROCEDURE:   PLAIN HELICAL SCANS.    FINDINGS: AT THE RIGHT KIDNEY THERE IS A 7MM CALCULUS AT THE UPPER POLE, 6MM CALCULUS AT THE MID POLE.  THERE IS AN 8MM CALCULUS WITHIN THE URETER AT THE PELVIC INLET WITH PROXIMAL HYDRONEPHROSIS.  THIS CALCULUS APPEARS TO HAVE SHIFTED FROM THE LOWER POLE OF THE KIDNEY AS SEEN ON THE PREVIOUS EXAMINATION.  THE SECOND CALCULUS MEASURING ABOUT 6MM IN DIAMETER SLIGHTLY MEDIALLY AND SUPERIORLY TO THE THIS URETERIC CALCULUS WAS PRESENT ON THE PREVIOUS EXAMINATION AND IS PROBABLY EXTRA URETERIC BUT COULD BE WITHIN THE URETER, IF SIDE IS UNCHANGED IN POSITION FROM THE PREVIOUS EXAMINATION.   IN THE LEFT KIDNEY THERE IS A 3MM CALCULUS AT THE MID POLE.  ALL OTHER  CALCULI ON THE PREVIOUS EXAMINATION WITHIN THE LEFT KIDNEY ARE NO LONGER  PRESENT. THERE IS NO LEFT URETER CALCULUS OR HYDRONEPHROSIS.  THE  OBSTRUCTING CALCULUS SEEN ON THE PREVIOUS EXAMINATION HAS PASSED.   REPORTED BY DR R HOILE

CT UROGRAM:    CLINICAL DETAILS:   HISTORY OF STAGHORN CALCULUS DIAGNOSIS JANUARY 2015.  NOW LEFT FLANK PAIN.   STONE IN URETER.   REPORT:   NO PRIOR STUDIES AVAILABLE FOR COMPARISON AT THE TIME OF REPORTING.  LEFT STAGHORN CALCULUS INVOLVING THE INFERIORLY POLE IS NOTED.  THERE HAS  BEEN A DISPLACED URETERIC CALCULUS MEASURING 20MM (748 HU) INTO THE PROXIMAL  LEFT URETER WITH ASSOCIATED MODERATE DILATATION OF THE PROXIMAL COLLECTING SYSTEM TO THIS.  NO DISTAL LEFT URETERIC CALCULUS EVIDENT.  NO BLADDER CALCULI SEEN.  THERE IS A SMALL CALCULUS IN THE INTERPOLAR REGION OF THE RIGHT KIDNEY ANTERIORLY MEASURING 2MM (343 HU).  NO OTHER RIGHT RENAL CALCULUS OR URETERIC CALCULUS SEEN.  THE RIGHT COLLECTING SYSTEM IS UNREMARKABLE.  THE OTHER MAJOR INTRA-ABDOMINAL ORGANS APPEAR LARGELY UNREMARKABLE WITHIN  CONSTRAINTS OF A NON CONTRAST STUDY.  NO FREE FLUID, FREE GAS OR INCIDENTAL  LYMPHADENOPATHY SEEN.  NO DESTRUCTIVE BONY LESION SEEN.   CONCLUSION:   DISPLACED LEFT INFERIOR POLE STAGHORN CALCULUS WITH THE CALCULUS MEASURING  20MM AND LOCATED IN THE PROXIMAL LEFT URETER WITH ASSOCIATED PROXIMAL  COLLECTING SYSTEM DILATATION.  UNCOMPLICATED RIGHT INTERPOLAR REGION RENAL  CALCULUS.  REPORTED BY DR. L. YAPP (JB).

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS    CLINICAL DETAILS:   LEFT RENAL CALCULUS. PROCEDURE:   UNENHANCED URETERIC CALCULUS PROTOCOL.   FINDINGS:   IN THE LOWER POLE OF THE LEFT KIDNEY THERE IS A SMALL CALCULUS MEASURING  6MM.  NO OTHER RENAL CALCULUS.   NO HYDRONEPHROSIS OR PERINEPHRIC SOFT TISSUE DENSITY.  NO URETERIC OR BLADDER CALCULUS.  MULTIPLE PHLEBOLITHS PRESENT WITHIN THE  PELVIS.  CHANGE RELATING TO GASTRIC SURGERY AND CHOLECYSTECTOMY NOTED.  THE LIVER, SPLEEN, ADRENALS, PANCREAS AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT ARE  NORMAL.  INFERIORLY WITHIN THE PELVIS ON THE RIGHT AN OVOID NODULE MEASURING 20 X  18MM MAY REPRESENT THE RIGHT OVARY.  NO LYMPHADENOPATHY OR ASCITES.   CONCLUSION:   LEFT LOWER POLE RENAL CALCULUS.
